       "     'value': '<p><em>Data Governance</em> sounds like a candidate for the most boring topic in technology: something dreamed up by middle-managers to add friction to data scientists&#8217; lives. The funny thing about governance, though, is that it’s closely related to data discovery. And data discovery is neither dull nor additional friction; it&#8217;s an exciting process that enables great data projects, ranging from traditional reporting to artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The idea of data governance originated in regulation and compliance. Not that long ago, data was a “wild west”: there were few rules and regulations about how it could be used or transferred, and most were industry-specific. That started to change with HIPAA, which covered medical data (though not much else). It changed in a big way with Europe&#8217;s GDPR, which enacted stringent requirements for how data is used and how individuals control the use of data about themselves; it also provided significant penalties for organizations that disobeyed the rules. In the US, California enacted a data privacy law (CCPA) that is similar to GDPR in many ways, and other states are likely to follow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The need for data governance is simple. People who work with data need to take those regulations into account. They need to track the data they have, where it came from, who was allowed to modify it, and how it was modified. If their dataset merges multiple data sources, they have to track those other sources. They need to be able to find and delete data on short notice if a customer requests it (for example, by exercising the GDPR’s “right to be forgotten”). They need to know how the data was collected—not just whether consent was requested and granted, but how their data sources were chosen. Who (or what) appears in the dataset? Are the data sources biased, and how might those biases affect results? And this requires a set of tools that is more sophisticated than dumping the data into a data warehouse or submerging it in a data lake. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But a funny thing happened. At the same time that companies had to prepare for increased regulation and scrutiny, they were also becoming more sophisticated about how they were using data. They were experimenting with machine learning and artificial intelligence; they were building models that could easily go astray (with embarrassing repercussions) if they were based on data that was out of date or erroneous. And they realized that their data science teams were spending an inordinate amount of time searching for data, which was frequently locked up in a departmental silo or submerged in a data swamp. They often compounded the time spent searching when they realized, after starting their analysis, the data they found was unusable. It was stale, incorrect, incomplete, badly described, or subject to any of a dizzying number of problems. If your data isn&#8217;t trustworthy, the results you get from that data won&#8217;t be trustworthy, either.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What did the data scientists need? Tools to help them find relevant data, understand its schema, understand how it was collected, understand how and where it was used and whether they could trust it. What did the compliance experts need? Tools to help them find relevant data, understand its schema so they knew just what was included in the data, understand how the data was collected, how and where it was used, and whether they could trust it. Pretty soon, people realized that these were almost exactly the same problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem boils down to managing metadata—the data about the data, the data that describes the data. Companies need to manage their metadata so they know what their data means: how it was collected, how the data is represented, how the columns in a table are defined, when the data was updated, and even how frequently it is accessed. Data that hasn’t been used for a few years probably hasn’t been used for a good reason. Companies also need to track restrictions on data’s use, who is allowed to access it, who is allowed to change it, and much more. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf\">Datasheets for Datasets</a> describes some of the metadata that has to be tracked to manage data effectively. Managing this metadata has often been handled by a “data steward”; but as data scales, delegating metadata management to a single person becomes ineffective. It&#8217;s impossible to keep up with all the data flowing into an organization—even a small one.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that&#8217;s what makes data governance interesting. It&#8217;s not just a requirement that&#8217;s imposed by external regulators. It&#8217;s about the process of understanding what data you have, what that data means, and how to use it. And it&#8217;s surprising (well, not to any data scientist) how few companies actually understand the data they have, and what they can do with it. And once you understand your data—what you have, what it means, where it came from—you’re finally in a position to use it effectively.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How does this look in practice? The open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/lyft/amundsen\">Amundsen</a> was started to enable <a href=\"https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9\">data discovery at Lyft</a>. It enables data scientists to search for data in Lyft&#8217;s “data lake,” and implements something like Google&#8217;s PageRank algorithm to rank relevant data sources. It also tracks who has accessed the data, how often, and when; data that is used frequently is more likely to be well-maintained. Although Amundsen was built to solve a supposedly different problem, it has also become a tool for data governance. It’s really about metadata management, and that’s at the heart of data governance.&nbsp; </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s also important to think about what metadata management tools like Amundsen <em>don’t</em> provide. Amundsen tracks data access, so there’s a virtual “paper trail” about how data was used, but it doesn&#8217;t implement any kind of access control. It won’t prevent someone from accessing data they shouldn’t; it just lets you document what happened after the fact. It’s better at tracking down a violation than preventing one. It also doesn&#8217;t track data lineage (at least, not yet), although users can add metadata about how data is modified and remixed. So it’s not a complete solution—but it’s a step toward a solution. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Going beyond metadata management, many data governance platforms are designed to enforce data access policies. They go beyond leaving a “paper trail” by restricting data access to those who have appropriate credentials, even on a record-by-record basis. They can also track data lineage, build data catalogs, and search for relevant data. Most of the commercial tools provide explicit support for regulatory compliance, such as GDPR and CPPA.&nbsp; </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Regardless of the tools, data governance and data discovery go together. You can’t use your data if you can’t find it. You can’t use your data if you don’t even know what data you have. And you’re still at risk of data breaches, legal liability, and violating customer’s trust, even if—especially if—you don’t know what data you have. Data governance starts with metadata. And once you understand that, you understand that by requiring you to manage your metadata, data governance is an enabler, not a hindrance. That’s when you can really think productively about how to use your data</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/bDh1ARjfuqw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

You already know the game and how it is played: you’re the coordinator who ties everything together, from the developers and designers to the executives. You’re responsible for the design, the product-market fit, and ultimately for getting the product out the door. But there’s a host of new challenges when it comes to managing AI projects: more unknowns, non-deterministic outcomes, new infrastructures, new processes and new tools. A lot to learn, but worthwhile to access the unique and special value AI can create in the product space.</p>\\n<p>Whether you manage customer-facing AI products, or internal AI tools, you will need to ensure your projects are in sync with your business. This means that the AI products you build align with your existing business plans and strategies (or that your products are driving change in those plans and strategies), that they are delivering value to the business, and that they are delivered on time. A PM for AI needs to do everything a traditional PM does, but they also need an operational understanding of machine learning software development along with a realistic view of its capabilities and limitations.</p>\\n<h2>Why AI software development is different</h2>\\n<p>AI products are automated systems that collect and learn from data to make user-facing decisions. Pragmatically, machine learning is the part of AI that “works”: algorithms and techniques that you can implement now in real products. We won’t go into the mathematics or engineering of modern machine learning here. All you need to know for now is that machine learning uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to &#8220;learn&#8221; by being trained on existing data. After training, the system can make predictions (or deliver other results) based on data it hasn’t seen before.</p>\\n<p>AI systems differ from traditional software in many ways, but the biggest difference is that machine learning shifts engineering from a deterministic process to a probabilistic one. Instead of writing code with hard-coded algorithms and rules that always behave in a predictable manner, ML engineers collect a large number of examples of input and output pairs and use them as training data for their models.</p>\\n<p>For example, if engineers are training a neural network, then this data teaches the network to approximate a function that behaves similarly to the pairs they pass through it. In the best case scenario, the trained neural network accurately represents the underlying phenomenon of interest and produces the correct output even when presented with new input data the model didn’t see during training. For machine learning systems used in consumer internet companies, models are often continuously retrained many times a day using billions of entirely new input-output pairs.</p>\\n<h2>Machine learning adds uncertainty</h2>\\n<p>With machine learning, we often get a system that is statistically more accurate than simpler techniques, but with the tradeoff that some small percentage of model predictions will always be incorrect, sometimes in ways that are hard to understand.</p>\\n<p>This shift requires a fundamental change in your software engineering practice. The same neural network code trained with seemingly similar datasets of input and output pairs can give entirely different results. The model outputs produced by the same code will vary with changes to things like the size of the training data (number of labeled examples), network training parameters, and training run time. This has serious implications for software testing, versioning, deployment, and other core development processes.</p>\\n<p>For any given input, the same program won’t necessarily produce the same output; the output depends entirely on how the model was trained. Make changes to the training data, repeat the training process with the same code, and you’ll get different output predictions from your model. Maybe the differences will be subtle, maybe they’ll be substantial, but they’ll be different.</p>\\n<p>The model is produced by code, but it isn’t code; it’s an artifact of the code and the training data. That data is never as stable as we’d like to think. As your user base grows, the demographics and behavior of the user population in production shift away from your initial training data, which was based on early adopters. Models also become stale and outdated over time. To make things even more challenging, the real world adapts to your model’s predictions and decisions. A model for detecting fraud will make some kinds of fraud harder to commit–and bad actors will react by inventing new kinds of fraud, invalidating the original model. Models within AI products change the same world they try to predict.</p>\\n<p>Underneath this uncertainty lies further uncertainty in the development process itself. It’s hard to predict how long an AI project will take. Predicting development time is hard enough for traditional software, but at least we can make some general guesses based on past experience. We know what “progress” means. With AI, you often don’t know what’s going to happen until you try it. It isn’t uncommon to spend weeks or even months before you find something that works and improves model accuracy from 70% to 74%. It’s hard to tell whether the biggest model improvement will come from better <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-your-neural-networks-a5e4617027ed\">neural network design</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/representation/feature-engineering\">input features</a>, or training data. You often can’t tell a manager that the model will be finished next week or next month; your next try may be the one that works, or you may be frustrated for weeks. You frequently don’t know whether something is feasible until you do the experiment.</p>\\n<h2>AI product estimation strategies</h2>\\n<p>Planning and estimation are difficult for AI products because it is rare to find two real-world systems where the training data and algorithms applied are the same.</p>\\n<p>Imagine you are a data scientist at Disney. Your division is starting a new video streaming service and you’re tasked with building a system to recommend movies. You might establish a baseline by replicating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering\">collaborative filtering</a> models published by teams that built recommenders for MovieLens, Netflix, and Amazon. There may even be someone on your team who built a personalized video recommender before and can help scope and estimate the project requirements using that past experience as a point of reference.</p>\\n<p>In this scenario, your Disney team appears to be solving a problem similar to the early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize\">Netflix Prize</a> recommendation problem. You have a highly curated catalog with a small number of professionally produced movies and TV series, and need to recommend those items to users based on their interests and viewing habits. Your team also needs to solve a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(computing)\">cold start problem</a> so you can recommend movies before the system begins collecting user feedback data (typically solved by using contextual topic-based or popularity-based recommendations), but once you gather explicit user ratings and video viewing data, you should be able to build a reasonable system. It may even be faster to launch this new recommender system, because the Disney data team has access to published research describing what worked for other teams.</p>\\n<p>But this is a best-case scenario, and it’s not typical. What if instead of a narrow, curated video catalog, you were building a <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45530\">recommender system for a consumer video app</a>, where anyone could create and upload user-generated content (UGC)? You might have millions of <a href=\"http://ai-lab-challenge.bytedance.com/tce/vc/\">short videos</a>, with user ratings and limited metadata about the creators or content. Social and trending signals in this network will be important, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/25/youtube-is-changing-its-algorithms-stop-recommending-conspiracies/\">controlling spam and abuse</a> will be a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-youtube-overrun-with-bogus-cancer-treatment-claims-11562072401\">challenge</a>. It may even be necessary to do <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45619\">image or video analysis</a> to make content-based recommendations, detect fraud, or reject content that violates your rules (for example, live shooter videos). You could still begin by shipping a simple cold-start recommender system, but it will take you much longer to build and iterate on your model to achieve the level of accuracy the business expects. You will likely encounter many challenges training your recommender with large amounts of constantly changing UGC and <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3346997\">conflicting objectives</a>.</p>\\n<p>These issues may be unexpected for teams that aren’t familiar with developing machine learning systems trained on user-generated content. If you ignore these complications during planning and assume your system will behave similarly to the original recommenders at Netflix, the project will end up significantly behind schedule, and may have serious abuse problems that Netflix didn’t face. In each of these examples, the machine learning problem faced by the business was similar (recommend movies to users), but the required approach ended up being very different based on subtle differences in the data and product design.</p>\\n<p>Predicting development time becomes even more difficult when you apply an algorithm successfully used in one domain to a different problem. Consider using the Netflix collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend jobs to job seekers. On the surface, these problems seem similar: we have a dataset of items (jobs) and users (job seekers), so, in theory, we could use a job seeker’s history of saved jobs or job applications to recommend similar new jobs. Complications arise when you consider the nuances of recruiting data and job applications. Features like geography and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/96116/ad-targeting-by-job-seniority-overview?lang=en\">job seniority</a> are critical to getting a good match. Job postings have a much shorter relevant lifetime than movies, so content-based features and metadata about the company, skills, and education requirements will be more important in this case. Job recommendations also include additional <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/10/building-representative-talent-search-at-linkedin\">algorithmic and regulatory challenges</a> related to diversity, bias, and fairness that are not encountered in movie recommendations.</p>\\n<p>The point isn’t that estimating AI projects is intractably hard; it’s that you aren’t likely to succeed if you expect an AI project to behave like a traditional software project. There are strategies for dealing with all of this uncertainty–starting with the proverb from the early days of Agile: “<a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork\">do the simplest thing that could possibly work</a>.” You don’t always need to start with a complex neural network; a simple regression (or even simpler, an average) might be enough to get your project off the ground. In some cases, that simple model may be all you ever need. The biggest problems arise from taking shortcuts and assuming that a machine learning model that works for one application will perform well in a different context without looking at the underlying data.</p>\\n<h2>Organizational prerequisites for AI at scale</h2>\\n<p>Particularly at a company that’s new to AI, part of an AI product manager’s job is helping the organization build the culture it needs to succeed with AI. Because it’s so different from traditional software development, where the risks are more or less well-known and predictable, AI rewards people and companies that are willing to take intelligent risks, and that have (or can develop) an experimental culture. As Jeff Bezos has <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/17-jeff-bezos-quotes-that-suddenly-take-on-a-whole-new-meaning-after-2-stunning-decisions.html\">said</a>, “If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away.”</p>\\n<p>No company wants to dry up and go away; and at least if you follow the media buzz, machine learning gives companies real competitive advantages in prediction, planning, sales, and almost every aspect of their business. If machine learning is so amazing, why hasn’t every company applied it and reinvented itself?</p>\\n<p>Even simple machine learning projects can be difficult, and managing these projects in a real business is <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/04/the-first-wave-of-corporate-ai-is-doomed-to-fail\">much harder</a> than most people realize; that’s why VentureBeat claims <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/\">87% of machine learning products never make it into production</a>, and Harvard Business Review says that “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/04/the-first-wave-of-corporate-ai-is-doomed-to-fail\">The first wave of corporate AI is bound to fail</a>.” Machine learning is not fairy dust you can sprinkle on your existing product. You can’t just plug in off-the-shelf cloud APIs that will magically make your product intelligent. Machine learning requires a complete rethinking; your products and your workflows are likely to change in fundamental ways. Product managers for AI need to lead that rethinking.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/\">VentureBeat</a> discusses two reasons for failure: management that believes you can solve problems by throwing money at them (whether that means hiring more, or better, developers), and data that is locked away into silos, where the people building your ML applications can’t get it. These are fundamentally cultural problems. You need to understand that many solutions can’t be bought (yet), that AI products require collaboration between teams, that data silos stand in the way of success, and that the best remedy for failure is picking yourself up and trying again. (To be clear, we are not saying that data can or should be used indiscriminately, without concern for legal compliance, customer privacy, bias, and other ethical issues.)</p>\\n<p>The need for an experimental culture implies that machine learning is currently better suited to the consumer space than it is to enterprise companies. For <a href=\"https://blog.tryexponent.com/consumer-enterprise-product-management/\">enterprise products</a>, requirements often come from a small number of vocal customers with large accounts. It’s difficult to be experimental when your business is built on long-term relationships with customers who often dictate what they want. Measurement, tracking, and logging is less of a priority in enterprise software. An enterprise company like Oracle has a lot of customers, but Oracle’s customer base is dwarfed by Amazon’s or Walmart’s. Consumer product management is typically more bottom-up, driven by large volumes of user feedback and usage tracking data. Many consumer internet companies invest heavily in analytics infrastructure, instrumenting their online product experience to measure and improve user retention. It turns out that type of data infrastructure is also the foundation needed for building AI products.</p>\\n<p>The ability to make decisions based on data analytics is a prerequisite for an “experimental culture.” This was the path taken by companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, which were <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-driven/9781491925454/\">driven by analytics</a> from the beginning. At measurement-obsessed companies, every part of their product experience is quantified and adjusted to optimize user experience.</p>\\n<p>These companies eventually moved beyond using data to inform product design decisions. They have deployed machine learning at scale to recommend movies and friends, personalize ads, and deliver search results. Their user agreements <a href=\"https://safety.google/privacy/data/\">allow them to use data</a> to improve their products. They’ve built the infrastructure needed to collect, manage, and analyze their data, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jamal.robinson/how-facebook-scales-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-693706ae296f\">deploy AI products</a> that can automatically make user-facing decisions in real time. By putting these pieces together, these companies created an environment where machine learning discoveries and innovation in AI are an integral property of their culture.</p>\\n<p>You are unlikely to succeed at AI if you haven’t laid a proper foundation for it. That foundation means that you have already shifted the culture and data infrastructure of your company. In “<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007\">The AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>,” Monica Rogati argues that you can build an AI capability only after you’ve built a solid data infrastructure, including data collection, data storage, data pipelines, data preparation, and traditional analytics. If you can’t walk, you’re unlikely to run. Just as AI product managers need to help build a culture in which they can succeed, they need to help define and build the infrastructure that will allow an organization to walk, and then to run.</p>\\n<p>If you’re just learning to walk, there are ways to speed up your progress. Although machine learning projects differ in subtle ways from traditional projects, they tend to require similar infrastructure, similar data collection processes, and similar developer habits. A relatively narrow project, like an intelligent search interface for your product, will require you to develop a lot of the basics, starting with the ability to acquire, clean, store, and analyze data. You’ll become familiar with the problems that real-world data presents. You’ll have to build the infrastructure that data projects require. Most important, you’ll start building relationships with other teams–and those relationships will become crucial when you tackle bigger projects.</p>\\n<p>The prospect of taking on a costly data infrastructure project is daunting. If your company is starting out on this path, it’s important to recognize that there are now widely available open source tools and commercial platforms that can power this foundation for you. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@l2k/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-team-when-you-are-not-google-or-facebook-f639238eafa2\">According to Lukas Biewald</a>, founder of Figure Eight and Weights &amp; Biases: “Big companies should avoid building their own machine learning infrastructure. Almost every tech company I talk to is building their own custom machine learning stack and has a team that’s way too excited about doing this.”</p>\\n<p>If you are still figuring out your analytics strategy, you are fighting the last war. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be thinking about AI, but it’s a goal, not the next step. Start with a simple project, build your infrastructure, learn how to use your data effectively, build relationships within the organization, then make the leap.</p>\\n<h2>Identifying “viable” machine learning problems</h2>\\n<p>Any product manager is part of the team that determines what product to build. If you are just starting out with AI, that decision is especially important–and difficult. The stakes are high–and you can be pardoned if you’re uncomfortable with ideas that are expensive and have an uncertain probability of success. Product managers are more comfortable with roadmaps that can get to market value in the next 12 months, and costs that can be kept to a minimum. AI doesn’t fit that model. An AI pilot project, even one that sounds simple, probably won’t be something you can demo quickly. You will struggle to make the case to invest in research upfront.</p>\\n<p>Therefore, you need to pay particular attention to defining a “minimum viable product” (MVP). How do you find an MVP, with the stress on both “minimum” and “viable”? What features should be deferred to later versions, and what belongs in the initial release? A demo, or even a first release, can be based on heuristics or simple models (linear regression, or even averages). Having something you can demo takes some of the pressure off your machine learning team. But you still need to answer the question: how do you tell the difference between technology you can productize now, and that which will be viable in an uncertain time frame? Most interesting things in AI are on the cutting edge of what we can do in engineering, and that makes them unpredictable: you don’t know when the engineering team will have the insight needed to make the product work. Those cutting-edge ideas are also attractive, both to managers who don’t understand the risks and to developers who want to try something that’s really challenging. And you, as the product manager, are caught between them.</p>\\n<p>Effective product managers for AI know the difference between easy, hard, and impossible problems. A good example of a problem that has been hard or impossible <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03186\">until recently</a> is generative text summarization. It seems like it should be within reach of our current machine learning algorithms, but in practice, accurately summarizing arbitrary text is still beyond the state of the art. You can generate text that, at first glance, appears to be written by a human, but upon closer inspection, you will often find it filled with factual and grammatical errors unacceptable in most business applications. This the “art of the possible,” an intuition for what is and isn’t feasible. It’s an intuition that you can learn through experience–and it’s why understanding your failures is at least as important as understanding your successes.</p>\\n<p>For AI products, one important part of being “feasible” is being precisely defined. As Jeremy Jordan says, “<a href=\"https://www.jeremyjordan.me/ml-requirements/\">A problem well-defined is half solved</a>.” It’s easy to look at the many successes of AI over the past few years and think that there’s some magic, but there really isn’t. If you can state what you want to accomplish very precisely, and break that down into even simpler problems, you’re off to a good start. Jordan has some good advice: start by solving the problem yourself, by hand. If you want to help customers organize pictures on their phones, spend some time on your phone, organizing pictures. Interview actual customers to see what they want. Build a prototype they can try with real data. Above all, don’t think that “we want to help customers organize pictures” is a sufficient problem statement. It isn’t; you’ve got to go into much more detail about who your customers are, how they want to organize their pictures, what kinds of pictures they’re likely to have, how they want to search, and more.</p>\\n<p>Another good proxy for identifying “viable” machine learning problems is to see how quickly you can construct a labeled benchmark dataset along with clear, narrowly defined accuracy goals for your ML algorithm. Data labeling ease is a good proxy for whether machine learning is cost effective. If you can build data labeling into normal user activities within your product (for example, flagging spam emails), then you have a shot at gathering enough input-output pairs to train your model. Otherwise, you will burn money paying external services for labeled data, and that up-front cost–before you can do your first demo–can easily be the most expensive part of the project. Without large amounts of good raw and labeled training data, solving most AI problems is not possible.</p>\\n<p>Even with good training data and a clear objective metric, it can be difficult to reach accuracy levels sufficient to satisfy end users or upper management. When you’re planning a product, it’s important to have a gut feel for what error rates are achievable and what aren’t, and what error rates are acceptable for your application. Product recommendations are easy; nobody is injured if you recommend products that your customers don’t want, though you won’t see much ROI. Fraud detection is riskier; you’re working with real money, and errors show up in your bottom line. Autonomous vehicles are a different matter; if you’re building an autonomous vehicle, you need AI that is close to perfect. (And perfect will never be achievable.) That kind of difference has a tremendous effect on how you structure the development process.</p>\\n<h2>Work on things that matter to your business</h2>\\n<p>The most important advice we can give is to make sure you work on AI products that matter to the business. It’s entirely too easy to define a problem, spend three to six months solving it, and then find out the solution works, but nobody cares; it doesn’t make a difference to the business. One of a product manager’s most important jobs is ensuring that the team is solving a problem that’s worth solving.</p>\\n<p>If you have a good data team and an intuitive understanding of your company’s data, there should be no shortage of ideas around how to improve your product. You will probably have more ideas than you can possibly use–so how do you prioritize the list of machine learning projects? How do you select what to work on? What delivers the greatest ROI? Shipping any machine learning system requires a huge mountain of organizational and data engineering effort, so the ultimate payoff needs to match that investment.</p>\\n<p>The buzz around AI has encouraged many people to think that AI can suddenly double or triple your profitability. That’s unlikely to be true–but what is likely? A product manager needs to be realistic about expectations. You shouldn’t over-promise, and you shouldn’t under-deliver. But neither should you under-promise: while simple products might help you to get started, you want to show upper management you can move the needle significantly. If the needle doesn’t move, you will undermine your team. If a product is feasible, if it’s something customers want, if you can get realistic error rates, and if you understand the development flows, you still have to ask whether it’s the best investment of time and resources. Is there another product that will generate a greater return more quickly?</p>\\n<p>To make these judgements, an AI product manager needs to understand the company’s data inside and out. That includes the ability to do your own analysis, to run SQL queries, to develop metrics, and to build dashboards. If you don’t understand your data intimately, you will have trouble knowing what’s feasible and what isn’t. You will have trouble understanding problems with data quality–you should know in your bones why 80% of a data scientist’s time is spent cleaning data. Without this data familiarity, you will have trouble spotting ethical problems that arise from biased or insufficient data. If you can’t define the right metrics to monitor, you won’t know whether or not your product is successful, nor will you know when your model performance has degraded (as it almost inevitably will).</p>\\n<p>Even if a product is feasible, that’s not the same as product-market fit. Is the product something that customers need? Will it help a small segment of customers or will it increase the most important metric for the majority of your users? Too many companies focus on building something cool without thinking about whether anyone really cares. Customers want you to solve their problems; they don’t care what kind of neural network you’re using. You may discover that you don’t need AI at all, and that’s just fine.</p>\\n<h2>Prioritizing with the business in mind</h2>\\n<p>There are a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features/answer/Adam-Nash\">number</a> of <a href=\"https://wavelength.asana.com/workstyle-the-process-and-math-behind-prioritization/\">different</a> <a href=\"https://www.sachinrekhi.com/how-to-prioritize-a-product-roadmap\">ways</a> to prioritize features into a product roadmap, and it&#8217;s likely your product organization already has its own preferred methodology for this. That said, there are many new machine learning teams working on a large number of projects without a clear prioritization or roadmap. Many companies invest a lot in hiring data scientists and building ML platforms, but then they focus them on solving the wrong problems.</p>\\n<p>One successful approach to this issue is to organize ML product feature ideas by theme and concentrate on a few high ROI projects. To prioritize, start with your company’s mission and near-term strategic objectives. What is the business trying to achieve? Pair a machine learning application directly to one of those objectives, so that when you improve the accuracy metric for your model it directly impacts metrics the business cares about. Build a direct connection between your machine learning application and something the company values.</p>\\n<p>For example, at LinkedIn (where co-author Pete Skomoroch previously worked) the mission was to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful. A strategic objective for the company was to become the professional profile of record and have complete and up-to-date resume data in the LinkedIn profiles for all professionals. A project idea under this objective was to create a machine learning model to <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/research/2014/linkedin-skills-large-scale-topic-extraction-and-inference\">recommend skills</a> a member should add to their profile. A team came up with an impact estimate for the product feature by estimating the expected increase in conversion rate when users were shown ML recommendations.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/artificial-intelligence/people-you-may-know\">People You May Know</a> (PYMK) was a successful example of this type of strategic alignment from LinkedIn&#8217;s data team. The PYMK recommendation system was trained on data including existing LinkedIn connections, profile similarity, and contacts imported from email to suggest other members a user should connect with. PYMK directly paired what the company wanted to do (drive connections) with a machine learning solution. With a small number of engineers, the data team built a production machine learning model that directly improved the most important metric for the company. Within months it also drove new user growth for the site and created a flywheel of user growth that was critical as LinkedIn became a public company.</p>\\n<p>Once you prune down the set of ideas to ones that align with strategic objectives, there are a number of ways to prioritize them. One effective approach is to get everyone in a room who will be building the system, and have the group form consensus estimates of difficulty, headcount, and impact for each project. Then you can create a chart of impact and ease, rank each project by return on investment and prioritize accordingly. In reality, prioritization is a messy and fluid process, as projects often have dependencies and face staffing limitations or conflicts with other stakeholder deadlines. Scope often needs to be reduced or <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bits-features-and-truth/\">quality sacrificed</a> to align with other teams or priorities.</p>\\n<p>Working on something that matters to the business is not the only important criteria to consider, since without access to data, your ML system will be useless. In larger companies, it’s best to start by focusing on business units that are eager to work with you and where your help is needed. When you begin development of your first ML product, try to work with teams that already have training data available and help them drive their most important metric. Ideally, that also aligns with the larger set of company priorities.</p>\\n<h2>Resources</h2>\\n<p>Where do you go from here as a product manager new to the world of AI?

This is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out\">garbage in, garbage out</a> principle: flawed data going in leads to flawed results, algorithms, and business decisions. If a self-driving car’s decision-making algorithm is trained on data of traffic collected during the day, you wouldn’t put it on the roads at night. To take it a step further, if such an algorithm is trained in an environment with cars driven by humans, how can you expect it to perform well on roads with other self-driving cars? Beyond the autonomous driving example described, the &#8220;garbage in&#8221; side of the equation can take many forms—for example, incorrectly entered data, poorly packaged data, and data collected incorrectly, more of which we’ll address below.</p>\\n<p>When executives ask me how to approach an AI transformation, I show them Monica Rogati’s <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007\">AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>, which has AI at the top, and everything is built upon the foundation of data (Rogati is a data science and AI advisor, former VP of data at Jawbone, and former LinkedIn data scientist):</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI Hierarchy of Needs\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/image1.png\"><figcaption>Image courtesy of Monica Rogati, used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Why is high-quality and accessible data foundational? If you’re basing business decisions on dashboards or the results of online experiments, you need to have the right data. On the machine learning side, we are entering what Andrei Karpathy, director of AI at Tesla, dubs the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\">Software 2.0</a> era, a new paradigm for software where machine learning and AI require less focus on writing code and more on configuring, selecting inputs, and iterating through data to create higher level models that learn from the data we give them. In this new world, data has become a first-class citizen, where computation becomes increasingly probabilistic and programs no longer do the same thing each time they run. The model and the data specification become more important than the code.</p>\\n<p id=\"F1\"><span id=\"F2\"></span>Collecting the right data requires a principled approach that is a function of your business question. Data collected for one purpose can have limited use for other questions. The assumed value of data is a myth leading to inflated valuations of start-ups capturing said data. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite/status/1116676992387244038\">John Myles White</a>, data scientist and engineering manager at Facebook, wrote: &#8220;The biggest risk I see with data science projects is that analyzing data <em>per se</em> is generally a bad thing. Generating data with a pre-specified analysis plan and running that analysis is good. Re-analyzing existing data is often very bad.&#8221; John is drawing attention to thinking carefully about what you hope to get out of the data, what question you hope to answer, what biases may exist, and what you need to correct before jumping in with an analysis<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. With the right mindset, you can get a lot out of analyzing existing data—for example, descriptive data is often quite useful for early-stage companies<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>\\n<p id=\"F3\">Not too long ago, &#8220;save everything&#8221; was a common maxim in tech; you never knew if you might need the data. However, attempting to repurpose pre-existing data can muddy the water by shifting the semantics from why the data was collected to the question you hope to answer. In particular, determining causation from correlation can be difficult. For example, a pre-existing correlation pulled from an organization’s database should be tested in a new experiment and not assumed to imply causation<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, instead of this commonly encountered pattern in tech:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>A large fraction of users that do X do Z</li>\\n<li>Z is good</li>\\n<li>Let&#8217;s get everybody to do X</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Correlation in existing data is evidence for causation that then needs to be verified by collecting more data.</p>\\n<p id=\"F4\">The same challenge plagues scientific research. Take the case of Brian Wansink, former head of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, who stepped down after <a href=\"http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/09/provost-issues-statement-wansink-academic-misconduct-investigation\">a Cornell faculty review reported</a> he &#8220;committed academic misconduct in his research and scholarship, including misreporting of research data, problematic statistical techniques [and] failure to properly document and preserve research results.&#8221; One of his more egregious errors was to continually test already collected data for new hypotheses until one stuck, after his initial hypothesis failed<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/09/26/651849441/cornell-food-researchers-downfall-raises-larger-questions-for-science\">NPR put it well</a>: &#8220;the gold standard of scientific studies is to make a single hypothesis, gather data to test it, and analyze the results to see if it holds up. By Wansink&#8217;s own admission in the blog post, that&#8217;s not what happened in his lab.&#8221; He continually tried to fit new hypotheses unrelated to why he collected the data until he got a null hypothesis with an acceptable p-value—a perversion of the scientific method.</p>\\n<h2>Data professionals spend an inordinate amount on time cleaning, repairing, and preparing data</h2>\\n<p>Before you even think about sophisticated modeling, state-of-the-art machine learning, and AI, you need to make sure your data is ready for analysis—this is the realm of data preparation. You may picture data scientists building machine learning models all day, but the common trope that they spend 80% of their time on data preparation is <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-data-catalog-data-scientists-productivity\">closer to the truth</a>.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"common trope that data scientists spend 80% of their time on data preparation\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/image2.png\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\\n<p>This is old news in many ways, but it’s old news that still plagues us: a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\">recent O’Reilly survey found that</a> lack of data or data quality issues was one of the main bottlenecks for further AI adoption for companies at the AI evaluation stage and was <em>the</em> main bottleneck for companies with mature AI practices.</p>\\n<p id=\"F5\">Good quality datasets are all alike, but every low-quality dataset is low-quality in its own way<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Data can be low-quality if:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It doesn’t fit your question or its collection wasn&#8217;t carefully considered;</li>\\n<li>It’s erroneous (it may say &#8220;cicago&#8221; for a location), inconsistent (it may say &#8220;cicago&#8221; in one place and &#8220;Chicago&#8221; in another), or missing;</li>\\n<li>It’s good data but packaged in an atrocious way—e.g., it’s stored across a range of siloed databases in an organization;</li>\\n<li>It requires human labeling to be useful (such as manually labeling emails as &#8220;spam&#8221; or &#8220;not&#8221; for a spam detection algorithm).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This definition of low-quality data defines quality as a function of how much work is required to get the data into an analysis-ready form. Look at the responses to my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugobowne/status/1164929866346749955\">tweet</a> for data quality nightmares that modern data professionals grapple with.</p>\\n<h2>The importance of automating data preparation</h2>\\n<p>Most of the conversation around AI automation involves automating machine learning models, a field known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning\">AutoML</a>. This is important: consider how many modern models need to operate at scale and in real time (such as Google’s search engine and the relevant tweets that Twitter surfaces in your feed). We also need to be talking about automation of all steps in the data science workflow/pipeline, including those at the start. Why is it important to automate data preparation?</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It occupies an inordinate amount of time for data professionals. Data drudgery automation in the era of <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28093/data-smog\">data smog</a> will free data scientists up for doing more interesting, creative work (such as modeling or interfacing with business questions and insights). &#8220;76% of data scientists view data preparation as the least enjoyable part of their work,&#8221; according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#747151796f63\">a CrowdFlower survey</a>.</li>\\n<li id=\"F6\"><span id=\"F7\"></span>A series of subjective data preparation micro-decisions can bias your analysis. For example, one analyst may throw out data with missing values, another may infer the missing values. For more on how micro-decisions in analysis can impact results, I recommend <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646\"><em>Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results</em></a><a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> (note that the analytical micro-decisions in this study are not only data preparation decisions). Automating data preparation won’t necessarily remove such bias, but it will make it systematic, discoverable, auditable, unit-testable, and correctable. Model results will then be less reliant on individuals making hundreds of micro-decisions. An added benefit is that the work will be reproducible and robust, in the sense that somebody else (say, in another department) can reproduce the analysis and get the same results<a href=\"#_ftn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>;</li>\\n<li>For the increasing number of real-time algorithms in production, humans need to be taken out of the loop at runtime as much as possible (and perhaps be kept in the loop more as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too\">algorithmic managers</a>): when you use Siri to make a reservation on OpenTable by asking for a table for four at a nearby Italian restaurant tonight, there’s a speech-to-text model, a geographic search model, and a restaurant-matching model, all working together in real time. No data analysts/scientists work on this data pipeline as everything must happen in real time, requiring an automated data preparation and data quality workflow (e.g., to resolve if I say &#8220;eye-talian&#8221; instead of &#8220;it-atian&#8221;).</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The third point above speaks more generally to the need for automation around all parts of the data science workflow. This need will grow as smart devices, IoT, voice assistants, drones, and augmented and virtual reality become more prevalent.</p>\\n<p>Automation represents a specific case of democratization, making data skills easily accessible for the broader population. Democratization involves both education (which I focus on in my work at <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/\">DataCamp</a>) and developing tools that many people can use.</p>\\n<p id=\"F8\"><span id=\"F9\"></span>Understanding the importance of general automation and democratization of all parts of the DS/ML/AI workflow, it’s important to recognize that we’ve done pretty well at democratizing data collection and gathering, modeling<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, and data reporting<a href=\"#_ftn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, but what remains stubbornly difficult is the whole process of preparing the data.</p>\\n<h2>Modern tools for automating data cleaning and data preparation</h2>\\n<p>We’re seeing the emergence of modern tools for automated data cleaning and preparation, such as <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/holoclean.html\">HoloClean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.snorkel.org/\">Snorkel</a> coming from <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/\">Christopher Ré’s group at Stanford</a>. HoloClean decouples the task of data cleaning into error detection (such as recognizing that the location &#8220;cicago&#8221; is erroneous) and repairing erroneous data (such as changing &#8220;cicago&#8221; to &#8220;Chicago&#8221;), and formalizes the fact that &#8220;data cleaning is a statistical learning and inference problem.&#8221; All data analysis and data science work is a combination of data, assumptions, and prior knowledge. So when you’re missing data or have &#8220;low-quality data,&#8221; you use assumptions, statistics, and inference to repair your data. HoloClean performs this automatically in a principled, statistical manner. All the user needs to do is &#8220;to specify high-level assertions that capture their domain expertise with respect to invariants that the input data needs to satisfy. No other supervision is required!&#8221;</p>\\n<p id=\"F10\">The HoloClean team also has a system for automating the &#8220;building and managing [of] training datasets without manual labeling&#8221; called Snorkel. Having correctly labeled data is a key part of preparing data to build machine learning models<a href=\"#_ftn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. As more and more data is generated, manually labeling it is unfeasible. Snorkel provides a way to automate labeling, using a modern paradigm called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a>, in which users are able to &#8220;inject domain information [or heuristics] into machine learning models in higher level, higher bandwidth ways than manually labeling thousands or millions of individual data points.&#8221; <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html\">Researchers at Google AI</a> have adapted Snorkel to label data at industrial/web scale and demonstrated its utility in three scenarios: topic classification, product classification, and real-time event classification.</p>\\n<p>Snorkel doesn’t stop at data labeling. It also allows you to automate two other key aspects of data preparation:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Data augmentation—that is, creating more labeled data. Consider an image recognition problem in which you are trying to detect cars in photos for your self-driving car algorithm. Classically, you’ll need at least several thousand labeled photos for your training dataset. If you don’t have enough training data and it’s too expensive to manually collect and label more data, you can create more by rotating and reflecting your images.</li>\\n<li>Discovery of critical data subsets—for example, figuring out which subsets of your data really help to distinguish spam from non-spam.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>These are two of many current examples of the augmented data preparation revolution, which includes products from <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.modeler.help/idh_idd_adp_objective.htm\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datarobot.com/webinar/minimizing-model-risk-automated-data-preparation-machine-learning/\">DataRobot</a>.</p>\\n<h2>The future of data tooling and data preparation as a cultural challenge</h2>\\n<p>So what does the future hold? In a world with an increasing number of models and algorithms in production, learning from large amounts of real-time streaming data, we need both education and tooling/products for domain experts to build, interact with, and audit the relevant data pipelines.</p>\\n<p>We’ve seen a lot of headway made in democratizing and automating data collection and building models. Just look at the emergence of drag-and-drop tools for machine learning workflows coming out of <a href=\"https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/01/google-automl-makes-adding-ai-as-simple-as-drag-and-drop.html\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/microsoft-launches-a-drag-and-drop-machine-learning-tool-and-hosted-jupyter-notebooks/\">Microsoft</a>. As we saw from the recent O’Reilly survey, data preparation and cleaning still take up a lot of time that data professionals don’t enjoy. For this reason, it’s exciting that we’re now starting to see headway in automated tooling for data cleaning and preparation. It will be interesting to see how this space grows and how the tools are adopted.</p>\\n<p>A bright future would see data preparation and data quality as first-class citizens in the data workflow, alongside machine learning, deep learning, and AI. Dealing with incorrect or missing data is unglamorous but necessary work. It’s easy to justify working with data that’s obviously wrong; the only real surprise is the amount of time it takes. Understanding how to manage more subtle problems with data, such as data that reflects and perpetuates historical biases (for example, real estate redlining) is a more difficult organizational challenge. This will require honest, open conversations in any organization around what data workflows actually look like.</p>\\n<p>The fact that business leaders are focused on predictive models and deep learning while data workers spend most of their time on data preparation is a cultural challenge, not a technical one. If this part of the data flow pipeline is going to be solved in the future, everybody needs to acknowledge and understand the challenge.</p>\\n<p><em>Many thanks to Angela Bassa, Angela Bowne, Vicki Boykis, Joyce Chung, Mike Loukides, Mikhail Popov, and Emily Robinson for their valuable and critical feedback on drafts of this essay along the way.</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<p id=\"_ftn1\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> For example, let’s say that you have existing data on how many users on your e-commerce website have clicked on items after a search. If you want to repurpose this data later on to rank your website’s search results, you need to correct for the bias introduced by the initial order when the data was collected.</p>\\n<p id=\"_ftn2\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> For example, Mikhail Popov, a data analyst at the Wikimedia Foundation, told me that they’re still getting new descriptive analyses out of years of existing data to get new insights on their users (especially editors) and trends. As a specific example: one of their biggest data sources is editing history across all their projects, publicly available at <a href=\"https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/analytics/\">Analytics Datasets</a>, which they use to answer ad-hoc questions like &#8220;across the 300 languages of Wikipedia, what % of newly registered accounts make an edit in their first 24 hours?&#8221; or to look at how readership traffic (pageviews also available publicly) has correlated historically with editing activity – which are all descriptive insights into their many communities.</p>\\n<p id=\"_ftn3\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Related is the supreme focus on “big data.” “Small data”, when collected in a principled, thoughtful manner can have a lot of signal. Look no further than the fact that <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/howcan-a-poll-of-only-100/\">a poll of only 1,004 Americans represents 260 million people with only a 3 percent margin of error</a>, when the sample is representative (this is rarely the case but there are sophisticated correction methods that can get experts close). Similarly, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7\">“thick (or qualitative) data”</a> can often tell us more than merely collecting more and more “big data”.</p>\\n<p id=\"_ftn4\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This is an example of what’s known as <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106\">p-hacking</a>.</p>\\n<p id=\"_ftn5\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> To paraphrase Hadley Wickham’s rendition of Tolstoy in <a href=\"https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf\">this paper</a>.</p>\\n<p id=\"_ftn6\">\\n<p><a href=\"#F6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> In which 29 expert teams are given “the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players.” 69% said “yes” while 31% said “no”. What’s even more concerning is that most teams were even more confident of their own results after seeing the other teams’ analyses.

Under his leadership, Assurant Solutions doubled in size to $4B, underwent a digital transformation to expand an offering of risk management solutions in the connected living space, and became established in 25 new markets around the world. After Lemasters left Assurant, he bought a company called GXG where, as the chief executive officer, he focuses on accelerating the growth of companies through rapid-cycle learning. (Disclosure: GXG is a partner of Science House, a consultancy I co-direct.)</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/leaders-need-to-mobilize-change-ready-workforces\">Jen Bruno</a> is the SVP of culture and human capital at LPL Financial, a firm founded to help entrepreneurial financial advisors offer independent financial guidance. Early in her career, Bruno was a florist who dreamed of working at the Walt Disney company. The dream became reality. (Disclosure: LPL is a client of my consultancy.)</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/an-enterprise-vision-is-your-companys-north-star\">Dana Codispoti</a> is the head of HR transformation at AIG. Previously, she worked at BNY Mellon and Morgan Stanley, and in multiple industries spanning consumer products, pharmaceuticals, and hospitality. With an engineering background and a mind for data and analytics, Codispoti is adept at leading change in processes that have scaled across large companies, with an eye for both humanity and technology.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/great-leaders-inspire-innovation-and-creativity-from-within-their-workforces\">James Jorasch</a> is the founding CEO of Science House, a New York-based consultancy that I co-direct. For 14 years prior to founding Science House, Jorasch was the head of inventing at Walker Digital. He’s a named inventor on more than 750 patents, including the patents at the core of Priceline, and his innovation work spans many industries, including retail, health care, and gaming.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Below, you’ll find notable themes that emerged during the discussions. You can see the full interviews <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/tag/big-systemic-thinking/\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Continuous learning and continuous improvement</h2>\\n<p>When people ask Craig Lemasters how long he ran Assurant Solutions, he says 44 quarters rather than 11 years.</p>\\n<p>“That’s how we think,” he said. “How do you free up time to think beyond a quarter or two or a year or two? We can do that. We can get to that place.”</p>\\n<p>But when Assurant’s distribution model—big box retailers—started collapsing, Lemasters wondered how he would shape the company’s future while focusing on the short term.</p>\\n<p>He knew it started with him as a CEO, but he didn’t know that other “lonely CEOs” were stuck in the same place. He engaged GXG (a company he later purchased) to help him over the hurdle by exposing him to the wisdom of others who navigated the same path. Continuous learning, especially from others who have developed wisdom from being in the same position, helps leaders get unstuck and become more agile.</p>\\n<p>Continuous learning is also required to understand the relationship between humanity and technology.</p>\\n<p>“Technology is driving and enabling at the same time,” Dana Codispoti said. “It’s a matter of how we use it. We need the human mind.”</p>\\n<p>From an HR perspective, Codispoti said, we need to go faster to get our minds ready. Companies should understand, among other things, the power of robotics and AI, along with the art of the possible, “while they are fixing the foundation,” Codispoti said. Too often, companies try to grasp at the next big thing without laying the foundation for learning first.</p>\\n<p>“There’s a whole world of things to learn,” Codispoti said. “I look at it as an enabler.”</p>\\n<p>Jen Bruno agreed. “Every business professional should consider themselves a continuous learner,” Bruno said. She noted that people need to be “change ready,”and get better at applying what they know in different areas for the greater good. Every company should get employees excited and engaged to learn because change keeps happening “faster than we can imagine.”</p>\\n<p>What makes a company a world-class learning organization?</p>\\n<p>“When people truly are in a mindset of continuous improvement,” Bruno said. “We can learn something from every person we meet. That’s good for business. Share talent and knowledge, and foster collaboration for greater outcomes.”</p>\\n<h2>Business lessons from technology processes</h2>\\n<p>Companies need a clear vision in a complex world, Codispoti said. “Create a north star that people can align to, that gets people excited about solving a problem,” she said. “Without it, they spin and spin and spin. If people don’t know how their work is value-add, you lose engagement. It ties to the enterprise vision.”</p>\\n<p>As more companies shift to Agile software development and, more importantly, an Agile mindset, the culture of companies has begun to mimic the iterative nature of technology. Smaller, granular pieces need to communicate with each other in the most effective way. This is true for microservices architecture, for example, and for people across teams.</p>\\n<p>Codispoti said that creating a process requires an end-to-end vision, but silos often lead to fragments being created piecemeal. “Once [a broken process] is enabled through technology and you want to make changes, it’s hard and people blame the technology,” Codispoti said.</p>\\n<p>Huge problems, James Jorasch said, need to be “distilled down to something that a client can understand and take action on.” Science House works with large enterprise clients, often on transformational software projects that can span years. The parallel between technology and people applies here, too.&nbsp; Making complex projects and transformations more modular creates a parallel impact on people and organizational structures, changing the nature of their responsibilities and spans of control. Bringing modular pieces together, whether the modules are temporal or functional, changes the role of traditional hierarchical organizational structures as they adapt to increased complexity.</p>\\n<p>“The nature of management is changing, and not just because of Agile,” Jorasch said. “It’s a different way of thinking. Managers have gone from managing people to managing processes, mindsets, skills, and problems.”</p>\\n<p>They also need to manage information flow into and from these groups.</p>\\n<p>“There are lessons learned from tech that will be applicable to people,” Jorasch said. “Where are the bottlenecks? What are the styles of thinking you need? Focus on what’s essential. How do you get the right information to the right person at the right time?”</p>\\n<h2>Humility is an asset</h2>\\n<p>One of the themes that came throughout the interviews was the need for humility. Without it, companies tend to stay inward looking and siloed.</p>\\n<p>“Companies struggle with cross-collaboration,” Codispoti said. “People tend to work in silos. They need to partner with experts in other areas. They don’t need to do it on their own, and they’re missing opportunities.”</p>\\n<p>Bruno and Lemasters both cited humility as a critical trait for leaders. Humility gives people the energy to cross over into an unfamiliar area, Bruno said, and creates the capacity for empathy.</p>\\n<p>“I look for the humility quotient,” Lemasters said. “A willingness for leaders to embrace outside thinking and ideas. Some would call it criticism, but it isn’t. Have the humility to accept people who have wisdom in their swim lanes. We learn quickly. There’s goodness in humanity, and people want to help.”</p>\\n<p>Jorasch often cites the need for not taking ourselves too seriously during innovation sessions, for example, because one person’s silly or half-formed comment gives another person a great idea. Humility helps prevent people from having to project authority or expertise every time they speak. With humility comes better listening; more honest, authentic input; less defensiveness; and more collaboration based on respect for one’s peers’ opinions.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/tag/big-systemic-thinking/\">Be sure to check out the full interviews for additional insights</a>.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/_YW6drzYyR4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>Rita J. King, co-director and EVP for business development at Science House, recently conducted a series of interviews with business leaders, exploring the challenges and hurdles companies face in evolving business landscapes. In this interview, King chats with Dana Codispoti, head of HR Transformation at AIG, about how to address the human factor in business transformations to keep employees engaged and connected to the overall business mission. They also discuss the future of the human-technology relationship and why technology should be viewed as an enabler rather than a replacement for human contributions.</p>\\n<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\\n<p>With technology iterating and improving at ever-increasing speeds, companies are challenged with how best to utilize data and analytics to inform new technology decisions. Codispoti stresses that it&#8217;s imperative to start with the foundation, the &#8220;building blocks,&#8221; and not jump straight to the innovation or &#8220;shiny object.&#8221; The key, Codispoti notes, to successfully navigating new technologies and processes lies with the people and their engagement with the company&#8217;s overall vision. &#8220;One of the most important things you need to do in technology initiatives,&#8221; she says, &#8220;is to create a vision to help people understand what they are driving toward. I see a lot of work being done in the trenches where people don&#8217;t see the bigger picture—everybody&#8217;s working on an individual project or set of projects, but they can&#8217;t understand how it fits into a broader picture. If there isn&#8217;t a vision for the company, create one, or create a North Star that people can align to. That gets people excited about a problem; it gets people excited about participating in the solution. &#8230; If people don&#8217;t know why their work is value add and how it ties to a broader picture, you lose engagement.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=118\">01:58</a>)</p>\\n<p>Mitigating risk is a hurdle for any company facing changing technology and business processes. Codispoti says the solution lies in breaking out of silos and comfort zones to leverage the expertise of colleagues across an organization. &#8220;I find companies struggle with cross collaboration,&#8221; She explains. &#8220;If someone&#8217;s, for example, working in a business, they need to leverage their partners. In my case, it would be HR, finance, the risk organization, the audit, and legal folks. I think people tend to work in silos, and they need to lift up their heads, look around and say, these people are experts in those areas. Talk through and partner with them to understand the problems they&#8217;re solving for so that they can help point out the risk. People think they need to do all that on their own, and they&#8217;re missing opportunities to mitigate risk. &#8230; It&#8217;s about breaking through silos and pointing out how collaboration is additive—when you work in teams, you get more. People also have a mindset that &#8216;I need to fix this for my area,&#8217; and it&#8217;s not an enterprise mentality. As you go through these transformations, it&#8217;s about trying to influence the culture to say you wear two hats: one is for whatever you&#8217;re working on and one is for the enterprise, and lead with that enterprise mindset.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=328\">05:28</a>)</p>\\n<p>Looking toward the future and humanity&#8217;s evolving relationship with technology, Codispoti stresses that machines will always need people and humans should not fear being replaced. &#8220;There&#8217;s a large level of awareness around technology driving the future in a lot of ways, but I think there&#8217;s also fear that technology is going to take over humanity—we know that&#8217;s not the case,&#8221; She says. &#8220;You need both. &#8230; At the end of the day, the work is in the work, in the process, in the culture, in the people, and then technology becomes an enabler. So, it&#8217;s driving and enabling at the same time, but I think everybody needs to co-exist. Nobody&#8217;s going to be wiped out by technology; it&#8217;s a matter of how we use it and we recognize that it can do things faster than we can, but in some ways we need the human mind to enhance whatever technology is doing.&#8221;(<a href=\"#t=880\">14:40</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/UNR8GT2bHms\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

King, co-director and EVP for business development at Science House, recently conducted a series of interviews with business leaders, exploring the challenges and hurdles companies face in evolving business landscapes. In this interview, King chats with Jen Bruno, SVP of culture and human capital at LPL Financial, about mobilizing a change-ready workforce, leadership rotation programs, and fostering continuous learning.</p>\\n<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\\n<p>The reality, Bruno argues, is that businesses are in a state of change. And while humans tend to have a hard time with change, the time is ripe for people to take advantage of the coming changes to grow and develop. &#8220;Companies have a hard time mobilizing a workforce that is change-ready because people inherently want to do what they know; we build our careers on the skills that have allowed us to move to the next level. We&#8217;re at a time right now where people can look beyond that and use those skills in another department or a new area; crossing over can enable the imagination, the creativity, and the innovation that companies so desperately want in order to grow and best serve their customers. It&#8217;s an exciting opportunity for people to think of themselves as change agents and be willing to crossover and work in different areas, leveraging what they know and learning what they don&#8217;t know. (<a href=\"#t=383\">06:23</a>)</p>\\n<p>Bridging culture gaps—and communication gaps— between departments is essential, Bruno says, to enable teams to work together efficiently and effectively to reap better outcomes. Creating these working relationship bridges, she argues, starts at the top. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of having leaders rotate through the different jobs within an organization. The true way to learn empathy is to do the work yourself and understand what the people in specific roles go through on a day-to-day business. You&#8217;ll have a better understanding of the business operation as a whole. I think it makes you a better business leader because it does help develop that empathy, and it allows you to build your network of people internally, and that&#8217;s really important too.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=656\">10:56</a>)</p>\\n<p>The key to weathering the transition to what work will become in the future, Bruno argues, is continuous learning. &#8220;Every business professional should consider themselves a continuous learner. There is so much to learn from other organizations that have similar situations, from business people we have things in common with, and it&#8217;s important to be change-ready and willing to leverage what you know in different areas for the greater good. We should all be preparing ourselves as much as we can so we can bring value to the companies we work for, whatever that might look like.&#8221; To that end, it&#8217;s important for learning and development approaches to evolve, she says, to be more effective in the face of the changes coming our way. &#8220;I hope I never see a PowerPoint presentation being held up in a room for an hour while somebody talks to an audience, because that&#8217;s not really fostering learning in a way that gets people excited and engaged.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=839\">13:59</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/JICZx5XMzRM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

In this interview, King chats with James Jorasch, founding CEO of Science House, about the importance of innovation and how to inspire and harness the creative talent in your workforce.</p>\\n<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s important, Jorasch says, to appropriate the techniques of innovation that bring together ideas from disparate sources and apply those to people in your company. &#8220;We need people also to collide; people with different perspectives, different concepts, different ideas need to come together over and over again.&#8221; He also notes that invention isn&#8217;t only an innate talent; it can also be a learned skill. &#8220;We train many people, and I would say that everyone can invent. Believe in yourself, relax, find a problem, come up with a solution, keep going. It&#8217;s not a complicated thing. Just believe in yourself and try. Trying is probably 90% of it.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=315\">05:15</a>)</p>\\n<p>To effectively get the creative juices flowing, Jorasch recommends ditching large meetings, as they allow people to avoid contributing by simply hiding in the crowd. &#8220;When you bring a meeting down to just two people, there&#8217;s no hiding, there&#8217;s no, &#8216;Well, I&#8217;m going to be on my cell phone. We&#8217;re working on this.&#8217; There&#8217;s no getting away from what you&#8217;re there to do. It is that sense of focus that you get from two people that really ignites the imagination process.&#8221; That focus, he says, is key to addressing the new challenges coming. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot that can be accomplished from creative pairs. It is a purpose driven, very focused way of tackling problems, and tackling very complicated and very deep problems. It takes away everything else—you&#8217;re lasered in on that one thing for, potentially, hours at a time. And that&#8217;s what it takes, right? 10-second solutions are not going to cut it in this world.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=449\">07:29</a>)</p>\\n<p>The data Science House has gathered from large companies over the years has afforded interesting insights into the changing nature of management, Jorasch says. For instance, in our increasingly Agile approaches to business and systems, the well-established, traditional hierarchy of individual contributor, manager, director, VP, SVP, and so forth, is no longer a great fit. &#8220;We have rules around the standard hierarchy,&#8221; he observes. &#8220;We don&#8217;t really have rules, per se, around Agile. And we&#8217;re seeing a collision of managers and directors now saying, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been a director for 15 years—what&#8217;s my role now with these Agile teams?&#8217; People are starting to question what it is they&#8217;re supposed to do.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not only evolving cultures and approaches challenging leaders, but evolving technologies, too. &#8220;The idea of using microservices, for example, is a very different way of thinking,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;Those managers and directors and VPs are evolving from managing people to managing a process or managing mindsets and skills of the workers, and managing problems or managing the information flow into these groups. That&#8217;s going to require a very different set of skills and new types of training.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=790\">13:10</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Uz6cibmqT1I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

In this interview, King chats with Craig Lemasters, CEO of Global Executive Group, about what companies face when navigating the digital transformation. They also talk about the power of humility and what it means to be an agile leader.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;Digital transformation&#8221; means something different to every company. The key to successfully traversing the transformation, Lemasters explains, is to identify specifically what it means to a particular company. In his case, he was running a global insurance company called Assurance Solutions, and he identified two specific areas of focus: &#8220;we knew we needed to have a digital relationship with the end consumer. &#8230; [And] we knew we needed to have some type of digital distribution model.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=153\">02:33</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To succeed in a new space, Lemasters came to realize, requires both knowledge and experience—an intersection Lemasters uses to define &#8220;wisdom.&#8221; This realization led to Lemasters&#8217; big &#8220;ah-ha!&#8221; moment: &#8220;The stumbling block for digital was, quite frankly, that we didn&#8217;t have either knowledge or experience on digital, and it started with me. I mean, it started with me even as a CEO. I started looking at my team and realized none of us really had a lot of knowledge and experience on this thing called digital. The whole &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; experience was that speed bump. What if we inserted knowledge and experience into the room—could we get to the point much quicker? That&#8217;s what&#8217;s become my passion &#8212; how do we interject this thing called wisdom into the conversation, into the process, just to get us there faster?&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=340\">05:40</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lemasters argues that humility is key to being a strong, agile leader. Being able to make decisions at the rate of speed required today takes, if not a village, at least <em>some</em> additional expertise. &#8220;The &#8216;humility quotient&#8217; is the willingness for leaders to literally embrace outside thinking,&#8221; Lemasters explained. &#8220;Some would call it criticism; it really isn&#8217;t. I mean, most of this work is about the unknown, and you just haven&#8217;t been there yet. What I found is if we just have enough humility to accept that and actually invite in some people who have the wisdom in these swim lanes, increasing the speed at which we learn, we get over ourselves pretty quickly.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=676\">11:16</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/cQpks9Bw11E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

High-level data topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage (left) and and the rate of change for each topic (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<h2>Unsupervised learning is growing</h2>\\n<p id=\"F2\">Interest in the unsupervised learning topic increased significantly, with usage up by 53% in 2018 and by 172% in 2019<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> (see Figure 1). What’s driving this growth?</p>\\n<p>First, for most people and most use cases, <em>supervised</em> learning serves as the default, assumed strategy for machine learning. That makes unsupervised learning worth noting as a separate topic, given the growth in engagement driven by more sophisticated users, improved tools, and use cases not easily addressed with supervised methods. By analogy, users are more apt to engage with specific supervised learning methods—e.g., linear and logistic regressions, support vector machines—than with the canonical topic of supervised learning itself.</p>\\n<p>Unsupervised learning, by contrast, isn’t as well understood, even if the names of its methods—e.g., clustering and association—and its applications (neural networks) are familiar to many users.</p>\\n<p id=\"F3\">In all likelihood, the surge in unsupervised learning activity on O’Reilly is being driven by a lack of familiarity with the term itself, as well as with its uses, benefits, requirements, etc. It’s likely, too, that the visible success of unsupervised learning in neural networks and deep learning<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> has helped spur interest, as has the diversity of open source tools, libraries, tutorials, etc., that support unsupervised learning. That some of these tools (<a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch\">PyTorch</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow\">TensorFlow</a>) are also Python-based doesn’t hurt, either.</p>\\n<h2>Usage in advanced techniques is up—mostly</h2>\\n<p>It’s said that the success of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network#History\">neural networks</a> and, especially, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#History\">deep learning</a>—neither of which is new—helped spur the resurrection of a number of other disused or neglected ideas.</p>\\n<p>One example is <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf\">reinforcement learning</a>, which experienced an exponential spike in usage on the O’Reilly platform in 2018—growing by 1,612%—before regressing slightly (-5%) in 2019 (see Figure 1).</p>\\n<p>Looking at AI/ML topic detail, we see usage in neural networks continuing its upward trend—up 52% in 2018; up 17% in 2019—but the related topic of deep learning dropped 10% in 2019. The drop in deep learning seems likely a function of inter-year noise and not evidence of an emerging trend, given the significant usage growth in 2018 (+52%). These closely related topics are popular: aggregating neural networks, deep learning, and TensorFlow usage nets nearly half (47%) of all AI/ML category usage, showing a slight decline (-3%) in 2019 after growing 24% in 2018.</p>\\n<p id=\"F4\">In our “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2020/\">AI adoption in the enterprise 2020</a>” survey, we found that deep learning was the most popular ML method among companies that are evaluating AI. Among companies using AI to support production use cases, deep learning was No. 2<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. It might be that—at 1% of platform usage and 22% of all AI/ML usage—deep learning has approached its asymptote. Growth could be slow from here on out.</p>\\n<h2>The rising AI/ML tide lifts (almost) all boats</h2>\\n<p>Another topic showing consistent growth is natural language processing (NLP) (see Figure 1). Its growth rate isn’t spectacular—+15% in 2018, +9% in 2019—but NLP now accounts for about 12% of all AI/ML usage on O&#8217;Reilly. That’s about 6x the share of unsupervised learning and 5x the share of reinforcement learning usage.</p>\\n<p>Interest in some methods or applications of ML seems to be waning, however. For example, the chatbots topic continues to decline, first by 17% in 2018 and by 34% in 2019. This is probably a reflection of the comparative maturity of the space. The chatbot was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot#Development\">one of the first applications of AI</a> in experimental and production usage. This likely doesn’t portend the end of interactions with occasionally helpful—and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html\">still sometimes horrifying</a>—customer service chatbots.</p>\\n<p>Computer vision usage shows a slow decline, falling by 3% in 2018 and 2% in 2019. Probably more noise than trend, moreover, computer vision accounts for about twice as much usage activity as the fast growing unsupervised learning topic.</p>\\n<h2>Python-based tools are ascendant in AI/ML</h2>\\n<p>Reports of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)\">Torch’s</a> death are <a href=\"https://github.com/torch/torch7\">somewhat misleading</a>. In fact, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch\">PyTorch</a>—a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern\">wrapper</a> that permits users to call Torch’s ML libraries from Python—posted triple-digit growth in usage in just the last few years, surging by almost 400% in 2018 and by 111% in 2019 (see Figure 1). PyTorch’s popularity is probably a function of the success of Python itself, particularly for ML and AI: vanilla Torch uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)\">Lua</a> as a wrapper to expose its core C libraries; PyTorch eschews Lua (in favor of Python) for the same purpose.</p>\\n<p>Once you factor <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis/\">in the preeminence of Python</a>, the rising popularity of PyTorch <a href=\"https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2019/4\">makes a lot of sense</a>.</p>\\n<p id=\"F5\">This may have something to do with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow\">TensorFlow</a>’s outsized presence in ML, too. In 2019, it accounted for 1% of all usage, about a third as much usage as machine learning and 22% of all AI/ML usage. TensorFlow isn’t a Python-exclusive technology—it exposes stable C <em>and</em> Python APIs<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>—but its users tend to be Python-savvy and its related projects, patterns, tutorials, etc., disproportionately involve Python.</p>\\n<p id=\"F6\">The results of our recent <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2020/\">AI adoption survey</a> underscore this trend. TensorFlow was also the No. 1 ML technology in the survey, while PyTorch came in at No. 4. Two additional Python-based tools (<a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras\">Keras</a>) also cracked the top five<a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. We know from <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis/\">our annual </a><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis/\">analysis of usage and search on the O’Reilly online learning platform</a> that one of Python’s fastest areas of growth is in ML- and AI-related development. The prominence of these and other Python-related tools attests to this fact.</p>\\n<h2>What’s in a name? The shift to “artificial intelligence”</h2>\\n<p>Does the growing engagement in neural networks, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and the increased focus on putting models into production augur a shift in how practitioners in the space frame what they do? We think yes, with practitioners increasingly calling their work “artificial intelligence”—a notion supported by the growth in AI usage on O’Reilly, the increasing embrace of sophisticated tools, and the empirical trend of putting those tools into production, which we see in our AI surveys.</p>\\n<p>AI has always been the general term for building intelligent systems, with machine learning covering the more specific case of building software that learns and modifies its outputs without the need for additional coding. Here are some examples of what, when viewed in aggregate, helps explain why those in the space think machine learning doesn’t quite cover all they do:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Machine learning produces models that are widely used in the automation of tasks such as credit scoring, fraud detection, recommendation engines, etc., but ML models are increasingly deployed in libraries or services and exposed via APIs—such that a model or ensemble of models can be invoked by any valid user, program, or service.</li>\\n<li>To some extent, models can be built with an aim toward reuse, such that, for example, a data profiling model can be invoked and used to support different business use cases.</li>\\n<li>Tools and techniques like reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning open up new use cases, including decision support, interactive games, real-time retail recommendation engines, and data discovery.</li>\\n<li>The focus of usage—and, with it, design and development—is shifting from the specific to the generalized. ML libraries and services have the potential to transform the software products we deliver, the processes that consume them, and—concomitant with this—the experiences of users, customers, partners, etc., alike.</li>\\n<li>This isn’t <em>just</em> ML; it’s a kind of AI: a new way of thinking about and applying machine intelligence. It has implications for software architecture, infrastructure, and operations—for virtually all domains.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>So, this isn’t <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\">artificial general intelligence</a>, but AI as the application of machine learning to solve problems, increase productivity, accelerate processes, and in many cases deliver wholly new products and services.</p>\\n<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\\n<p>As organizations adopt analytic technologies, they’re discovering more about themselves and their worlds. Adoption of ML, especially, prompts people at all levels of an organization to start asking questions that challenge in different ways what the organization <a href=\"https://www.eckerson.com/articles/the-data-modeling-conundrum-do-you-create-a-model-from-the-real-or-the-ideal\">thinks it knows about itself</a>.</p>\\n<p>An organization’s use of ML tools and techniques, and the contexts in which it uses them, will tend to change, too. For example, the techniques of supervised learning are useful for classifying known-knowns and for elucidating certain kinds of known-unknowns; they’re unsuitable for surfacing <a href=\"https://scet.berkeley.edu/artificial-intelligence-and-the-rumsfeld-test/\">unknown-unknowns</a>, however. Unsupervised techniques are better for this. Not for classifying, synthesizing, or <em>understanding</em> unknown-unknowns—that’s the responsibility of human intelligence—but for <em>surfacing them in the first place</em>. The upshot is that adopters are integrating <em>both</em> kinds of learning into their ML practices. They’re also apt to experiment with advanced ML methods—such as deep learning—that have applications for both supervised and unsupervised learning. In fact, we found in our AI adoption survey that those new to ML are almost as likely to experiment with deep learning as mature adopters.</p>\\n<p>Right now, companies are successfully using ML to ferret out known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns in their business worlds. They’re instantiating what they discover, analyze, and understand about their worlds in models. Some are also starting to incorporate these models into automated, quasi-intelligent products, services, and software. All of this partakes of the propulsive logic of self-discovery. It’s at the root of a question Plato first formulated almost 2,500 years ago: “But how will you look for something when you don’t in the least know what it is?” he has Meno ask Socrates. “How on earth are you going to set up something you don’t know as the object of your search?”</p>\\n<p>Philosophical tradition <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-paradoxes/#MenParInqPuzAboGaiKno\">treats this question as a paradox</a>. It’s also possible to see it as an inquiry into how an object of knowledge augments and transforms <em>itself</em>. With ML and AI, we’re training machines to surface new objects of knowledge that help us as we learn to ask new, different, and sometimes difficult questions about ourselves. By all indications, we seem to be having some success with this.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<p id=\"_ftn1\"><a href=\"#F1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This article is based on non-personally-identifiable information about the top search terms and most-used topics on O’Reilly online learning.

       "     'value': '<p>Even with a stellar crisis plan, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a set of challenges unprecedented in our lifetimes. We don’t know what’s going to happen, and we’re dealing with something growing exponentially, creating uncertainty on a global scale. I managed a team of 40 in Singapore during SARS. That crisis was different, hitting Singapore and a handful of other cities. But plenty of parallels exist: it was a health crisis, and the lessons learned might serve you and your organization well now. Here are some things to do immediately, including addressing issues around remote work, to ensure that business continues as usual.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>This <em>is</em> your full-time job right now</strong>. Whatever was on your priority list last month, isn’t anymore. This is your full-time job right now. That means you may need to tell the C-suite that their pet project has been delayed, and you may need to tell employees that performance reviews and team meetings are on hold. You and your team may be working very long days in the coming weeks.</li>\\n<li><strong>Push communications twice a day</strong>. In the arc of a crisis, we don’t know quite where we are—and that uncertainty can cause panic for some employees. News is coming out fast and good information is hard to come by. Create a morning and late afternoon update so your people know you are paying attention to their well-being. Share new information and repeat facts you already know. As we move from crisis to recovery—and we will recover—your updates can move from twice a day back to once a day and, then, less often.</li>\\n<li><strong>Let go of perfection</strong>. It’s better to send out a revised set of rules everyday rather than being silent for days while executives try to land on the perfect policy and ideal language. Modify standard policies and make exceptions to long-held rules. Be transparent—it’s OK not to have all the answers because there are few definitive answers. Be transparent and say what you know and admit what you don’t know.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor the CDC and your state health authorities</strong>. There will be rumors, fake news, and speculation. The only thing we know is that we have never been through this before. In 1918 during the Spanish Flu, it took days to cross the Atlantic and antibiotics hadn’t been invented. Because this is unprecedented in our modern world, the CDC and your state health authorities are doing admirable work providing the most reliable and trustworthy information.</li>\\n<li><strong>People will respond very differently—prepare for that to cause problems</strong>. Some people may begin refusing to come to work—others might seem cavalier about COVID19. That divide may create serious friction in your organization. People who come to work begin to resent those who don’t. Those who stay home begin to believe that some of their co-workers don’t care about the health of families. After SARS, it took a long time to heal this split in the office. Acknowledge the split and that both points of view are valid.</li>\\n<li><strong>Create new remote work guidelines—today</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you change these guidelines (see #3), just put out some basics. Is there a daily meeting? Will teams need to check in every day? What tools should they use? Should all meeting participants turn on their video? Whatever you decide—put out some guidelines so people have a place to start. You can modify these tomorrow and completely rewrite them when the crisis passes.</li>\\n<li><strong>We may not return to “business as usual.”</strong> You are going to want to reassure people, and that may be an important part of your job. Tell people it will be OK—because it will. But be careful: don’t make any promises, because “OK” may not mean what it used to mean. Companies will likely make changes during the crisis or as things begin to recover. And, this may be an opportunity to change how your organization works. You are going to learn things about how your people learn, adapt, and improvise that will inform the new future.</li>\\n<li><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. This is a marathon not a sprint. And, to carry that metaphor forward, we don’t know the course of the marathon. We know some of you have been working around the clock—that’s not going to end tomorrow. If you aren’t healthy and grounded, you can’t see your team through this. Ground yourself; whatever gives you peace and contentment—you need that now, for you, for your family, and for the demands of your work.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/zsrywhHLzI8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>Last year, when we felt interest in artificial intelligence (AI) was approaching a fever pitch, we created a survey to ask about AI adoption. When we analyzed the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">results</a>, we determined the AI space was in a state of rapid change, so we eagerly commissioned a follow-up survey to help find out where AI stands right now. The new survey, which ran for a few weeks in December 2019, generated an enthusiastic 1,388 responses. The update sheds light on what AI adoption looks like in the enterprise— hint: deployments are shifting from prototype to production—the popularity of specific techniques and tools, the challenges experienced by adopters, and so on. There’s a lot to bite into here, so let’s get started.</p>\\n<p>Key survey results:</p>\\n<ul id=\"F1\">\\n<li>The majority (85%) of respondent organizations are evaluating AI or using it in production<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>. Just 15% are not doing anything at all with AI.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ul>\\n<li>More than half of respondent organizations identify as “mature” adopters of AI technologies: that is, they’re using AI for analysis or in production.</li>\\n<li>Supervised learning is the most popular ML technique among mature AI adopters, while deep learning is the most popular technique among organizations that are still evaluating AI.</li>\\n<li>Though a problem, the lack of ML and AI skills isn’t the biggest impediment to AI adoption. Almost 22% of respondents identified a lack of institutional support as the most significant issue.</li>\\n<li>Few organizations are using formal governance controls to support their AI efforts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The takeaway: AI adoption is proceeding apace. Most companies that were evaluating or experimenting with AI are now using it in production deployments. It’s still early, but companies need to do more to put their AI efforts on solid ground. Whether it’s controlling for common risk factors—bias in model development, missing or poorly conditioned data, the tendency of models to degrade in production—or instantiating formal processes to promote data governance, adopters will have their work cut out for them as they work to establish reliable AI production lines.</p>\\n<h2>Respondent demographics</h2>\\n<p>Survey respondents represent 25 different industries, with “Software” (~17%) as the largest distinct vertical. The sample is far from tech-laden, however: the only other explicit technology category—“Computers, Electronics, &amp; Hardware”—accounts for less than 7% of the sample. The “Other” category (~22%) comprises 12 separate industries.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Industry of survey respondents\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/1-industry.png\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Industry of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Data scientists dominate, but executives are amply represented</h3>\\n<p>One-sixth of respondents identify as data scientists, but executives—i.e., directors, vice presidents, and CxOs—account for about 26% of the sample. The survey does have a data-laden tilt, however: almost 30% of respondents identify as data scientists, data engineers, AIOps engineers, or as people who manage them. What is more, almost three-quarters of survey respondents say they work with data in their jobs. All told, more than 70% of respondents work in technology roles.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Role of survey respondents\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/2-role.png\"><figcaption>Figure 2. Role of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Regional breakdown</h3>\\n<p>Close to 50% of respondents work in North America, most of them in the United States, which by itself is home to almost 40% of survey participants. Western Europe (~23%) was the next largest region, followed by Asia at 15%. Participants from South America, Eastern Europe, Oceania, and Africa account for roughly 15% of responses.</p>\\n<h2>Analysis: The state of AI adoption today</h2>\\n<p id=\"F2\">More than half of respondent organizations are in the “mature” phase of AI adoption (using AI for analysis/production), while about one-third are still evaluating AI<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>. This is close to a mirror image of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">last year’s AI survey results</a>, when 54% of respondent organizations were evaluating AI and just 27% were in the “mature” adoption phase. This year, about 15% of respondent organizations are not doing anything with AI, down ~20% from our 2019 survey.</p>\\n<p>The upshot is that 85% of organizations are using AI, and (of these) most are using it in production. It seems as if the experimental AI projects of 2019 have borne fruit. But what kind?</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Where AI projects are being used within companies\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/3-functional-parts-of-companies.png\"><figcaption>Figure 3. Where AI projects are being used within companies.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The bulk of AI use is in research and development—cited by just under half of all respondents—followed by IT, which was cited by just over one-third. (Respondents were encouraged to make multiple selections.) Another high-use functional area is customer service, with just under 30% of share. Two functional areas—marketing/advertising/PR and operations/facilities/fleet management—see usage share of about 20%. Clearly respondent organizations see the value of AI in a raft of different functional organizations, and the flat results from last year show a consistency to that pattern.</p>\\n<h2>Common challenges to AI adoption</h2>\\n<p>The acquisition and retention of AI-specific skills remains a significant impediment to adoption in most organizations. This year, slightly more than one-sixth of respondents cited difficulty in hiring/retaining people with AI skills as a significant barrier to AI adoption in their organizations. This is down, albeit slightly, from 2019, when 18% of respondents blamed an AI skills gap for lagging adoption.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Bottlenecks to AI adoption\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/4-bottlenecks.png\"><figcaption>Figure 4. Bottlenecks to AI adoption.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Believe it or not, a skills gap isn’t the biggest impediment to AI adoption. In 2020, as in 2019, a plurality of respondents—almost 22%—identified a lack of institutional support as the biggest problem. In both 2019 and 2020, the AI skills gap actually occupied the <em>No. 3</em> slot; this year, it trailed “Difficulties in identifying appropriate business use cases,” which was cited by 20% of respondents.</p>\\n<p>A more detailed look at the bottleneck data shows executives selecting an unsupportive culture less often (15%) than the practitioners and managers (23%) who responded to the survey.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Bottlenecks to AI adoption with AI maturity level\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/5-bottlenecks-with-maturity.png\"><figcaption>Figure 5. Bottlenecks to AI adoption with AI maturity level.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>By a 2:1 margin, respondents in companies that are evaluating AI are much more likely to cite an unsupportive culture as the primary bulwark to AI adoption. This disparity is striking—and intriguing. Is it just the case that late-adopters are <em>ipso facto</em> more resistant to—less open to—AI?</p>\\n<p>By contrast, AI adopters are about one-third more likely to cite problems with missing or inconsistent data. We saw in our “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-data-quality-in-2020/\">State of Data Quality in 2020</a>” survey that ML and AI projects tend to surface latent or hidden data quality issues, with the result that organizations that are using ML and AI are more likely to identify issues with the quality or completeness of their data. The logic in this case partakes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in%2C_garbage_out\">garbage-in, garbage out</a>: data scientists and ML engineers need quality data to train their models. Companies evaluating AI, by contrast, may not yet know to what extent data quality can create AI woes.</p>\\n<h2>AI/ML skill shortages: Consistent and persistent</h2>\\n<p>We asked survey respondents to identify the most critical ML- and AI-specific skills gaps in their organizations. The shortage of ML modelers and data scientists topped the list, cited by close to 58% of respondents. The challenge of understanding and maintaining a set of business use cases came in at number two, cited by almost half of participants. (Survey takers could choose more than one selection.) Close to 40% selected data engineering as a practice area for which skills are lacking. Finally, just under one quarter highlighted a lack of compute infrastructure skills.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI/ML skills gaps within organizations\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/6-skills-gaps.png\"><figcaption>Figure 6. AI/ML skills gaps within organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The most remarkable thing about these results is their year-over-year consistency. The same skill areas that were problematic in 2019 are again problematic in 2020—and by about the same margins. In 2019, 57% of respondents cited a lack of ML modeling and data science expertise as an impediment to ML adoption; this year, slightly more—close to 58%—did so. This is true of other in-demand skills, too. The uncomfortable truth is that the most critical skill shortages cannot easily be addressed. The data scientist, for example, is a hybrid creature: ideally, she should possess not only theoretical and technical expertise, but practical, domain-specific business expertise, too.</p>\\n<p>This last is almost always acquired in practice, with the result that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428f1502-2b5c-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381\">the freshly minted data scientist</a> is invariably trained on the job. This helps explain why the proportion of respondents who cited a shortage of people skilled in understanding and maintaining business use cases increased year over year, from 47% in 2019 to 49% this year. The data scientist uses her domain-specific expertise to identify appropriate business use cases for AI. The ML modeler supplements her technical competency with domain-specific business knowledge that she accrues in practice. Both types of practitioner must also develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills\">soft skills</a> in team work, listening, and, most important, <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/articles/book-review-empathy-at-work/\">empathy</a>. This takes time and is a function of experience.</p>\\n<h2>Managing AI/ML risk</h2>\\n<p>We asked respondents to select all of the applicable risks they try to control for in building and deploying ML models. The results suggest that <em>all</em> organizations—especially those with “mature” AI practices—are alert to the risks inherent in the design and use of ML and AI technologies.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Risks checked for during ML model building and deployment (with AI adoption maturity level)\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/7-risks.png\"><figcaption>Figure 7. Risks checked for during ML model building and deployment (with AI adoption maturity level).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Unexpected outcomes/predictions was the single most common risk factor, cited by close to two-thirds of mature—and by about 53% of still-evaluating—AI practitioners. Among mature adopters, the need to control for the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08883.pdf\">interpretability and transparency</a> of ML models was the second most common risk factor (cited by about 55%); by contrast, a different option—fairness, bias, and ethics (~40%)—was the No. 2 risk factor among companies still evaluating AI. It ranks high (No. 3) with mature AI practitioners, too: ~48% check for fairness and bias during model building and deployment.</p>\\n<p>Mature AI practitioners are significantly more likely to implement checks for model degradation than companies that are still evaluating AI. Model degradation is the No. 4 risk factor among mature adopters (checked for by about 46%); however, it is next to last among organizations that are in the evaluation phase of AI adoption—finishing ahead of the “Other compliance” category.</p>\\n<p>These risk factors are common, well understood, and don’t stand alone. With respondents able to pick “all that apply” to the question, we find that 41% of respondents list at least four issues, and 61% select at least three issues.</p>\\n<h2>Supervised learning is dominant, deep learning continues to rise</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning\">Supervised learning</a> remains the most popular ML technique among all adopters. In 2019, more than 80% of mature adopters—and two-thirds of respondent organizations that were then evaluating AI—used it. And in 2020, almost 73% of self-identified “mature” AI practices are using it. (The survey questionnaire encouraged respondents to select all applicable techniques.)</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI technologies organizations are using (with AI adoption maturity level)\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/8-ai-technologies.png\"><figcaption>Figure 8. AI technologies organizations are using (with AI adoption maturity level).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>This year, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\">deep learning</a> displaced supervised learning as the most popular technique among organizations that are in the evaluation phase of AI adoption. To wit: in respondent organizations that are evaluating AI, slightly more say they’re using deep learning (~55%) than supervised learning (~54%). And close to 66% of respondents who work for “mature” AI adopters say they’re using deep learning, making it the second most popular technique in the mature cohort—behind supervised learning.</p>\\n<p>It’s true that usage of all ML or AI techniques is greater among mature adopters than among organizations still evaluating AI. That said, there are a number of striking differences between mature and less mature AI adopters. For example, about 23% of “mature” AI practices use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning\">transfer learning</a>, nearly double the rate of usage in less mature practices (12%). <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/humans-loop-design-interactive-ai-systems\">Human-in-the-loop</a> AI models are considerably more popular among mature users than among those still evaluating AI.</p>\\n<p>Selecting the right tool for the job has more than three-quarters (78%) of respondents selecting at least two of ML techniques, 59%, using at least three, and 39% choosing at least four.</p>\\n<h2>The dominant tools aren’t getting any less dominant</h2>\\n<p>TensorFlow remains, by far, the single most popular tool for use in AI-related work. It was cited by almost 55% of respondents in both 2019 and 2020, which gives it a creditable consistency over time.</p>\\n<p>TensorFlow’s staying power also reinforces the fact that deep learning and neural networks—with which it is strongly associated—are far from niche techniques.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI tools organizations are using\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/9-ai-tools.png\"><figcaption>Figure 9. AI tools organizations are using.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The most popular tools for AI development in 2019 were once again predominant in 2020. This could be a function of what we’ll call the “Python factor,” however: four of the five most popular tools for AI-related work are either Python-based or <a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\">dominated by Python tools, libraries, patterns, and projects</a>.</p>\\n<p>Of these, TensorFlow, <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras\">Keras</a> held steady, while PyTorch grew its share to more than 36%. This tracks with usage and search activity on the O’Reilly online learning platform, where interest in PyTorch has grown quickly from a relatively small base. Our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis\">analysis of Python-related activity on O’Reilly</a> likewise shows that Python is seeing explosive growth in ML and AI-related development.</p>\\n<h2>Data governance isn’t yet a priority</h2>\\n<p>Slightly more than one-fifth of respondent organizations have implemented formal data governance processes and/or tools to support and complement their AI projects. This is consistent with the results of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-data-quality-in-2020/\">our data quality survey</a>.</p>\\n<p>The good news is that just over 26% of respondents say their organizations plan to instantiate formal data governance processes and/or tools by 2021; almost 35% expect this to happen in the next three years. The bad news is that AI adopters—much like organizations everywhere—seem to treat data governance as an additive rather than an essential ingredient.</p>\\n<p>Ideally, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance#Science\">data provenance</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage\">data lineage</a>, consistent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_specification\">data definitions</a>, rich <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_management\">metadata management</a>, and other essentials of good data governance would be baked into, not grafted on top of, an AI project.</p>\\n<p>Think of data governance as analogous to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/ch01.html\">observability</a> in software development: it is easier to build a capacity for observability into a system than to retrofit an existing system to make it observable. In the same way, it is easier to build a capacity for data governance into a system or service than to “add” it after the fact. Data governance is a data-specific take on observability that not only permits traceability and reproducibility, but permits transparency into what an AI asset is doing—and how it’s doing it.</p>\\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\\n<p>A review of the survey results yields a few takeaways organizations can apply to their own AI projects.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>If you do not have plans to evaluate AI, it’s time to think about catching up. With an abundance of open source tools, libraries, tutorials, etc., not to mention an accessible <em>lingua franca</em>—Python—the bar for entry is actually pretty low. Most companies are experimenting with AI—why risk being left behind?</li>\\n<li>AI projects align with dominant trends in software architecture and infrastructure and operations. AI features can be decomposed into functional primitives and instantiated as microservices—e.g., data cleansing services that profile data and generate statistics, perform deduplication and fuzzy matching, etc.—or function-as-a-service designs.</li>\\n<li>Think broadly: AI is used everywhere, not just in R&amp;D and IT. A large share of survey respondents use AI in customer service, marketing, operations, finance, and other domains.</li>\\n<li>Train your organization, too—not just your models. Institutional support remains the biggest barrier to AI adoption. If you think AI can help, you should spend time explaining how, why, and what to expect.</li>\\n<li>The risks associated with AI implementation are consistent and now better understood. The upshot is that it’s easier to explain to executives and stakeholders what to expect in implementing AI projects.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\\n<p>Clearly, we see AI practices maturing, even if many production use cases appear primitive. Adopters are also taking proactive steps to control for the most common risk factors. Both mature and not-so-mature adopters are experimenting with sophisticated techniques to build their AI products and services. Adopters are using a wide variety of ML and AI tools, but have coalesced around a single language—the ubiquitous, irrepressible Python. However, organizations need to address important data governance and data conditioning to expand and scale their AI practices.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<p id=\"_ftn1\"><a href=\"#F1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> We define “production” as the use of AI models in deployed applications that either serve users or are exposed as part of an automated, repeatable process—such as data collection, profiling, cleansing, and engineering. This is distinct from AI models that are used for static predictive analytics, categorization studies, natural language tasks, or for other analytic purposes.</p>\\n<p id=\"_ftn2\"><a href=\"#F2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> We asked participants to distinguish between “mature” adoption and “evaluation” on the basis of the following criteria: “None” (no use of AI in any projects); “Evaluation” (limited to trial evaluations and proofs-of-concept); “Analysis” (exploring, classifying, summarizing, and organizing data); and “Production” (revenue-bearing AI projects that are used in production). We group those respondents that selected “Analysis” and “Production” into our “mature” cohort.</p>\\n</aside>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/51j23cc8IHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

That’s a trend that bears watching for the next few years; it’s starting to pay off with some <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615141/an-algorithm-that-can-spot-cause-and-effect-could-supercharge-medical-ai/\">medical AI technology</a> that looks for <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-02-ai-relationships-overlapping-medical-datasets.html\">cause and effect</a>, not just correlation.</li>\\n<li> <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-isnt-hard-anymore-26db0d4749d7\">Democratization of deep learning</a> isn’t a new idea, but we haven’t thought much about how democratization progresses. Pre-trained and partially trained models significantly reduce the cost of training and the time needed to train a system, along with the expertise required.</li>\\n<li> One of the biggest issues facing AI is the transition from research and development to production and operations. One aspect of this transition is the challenge of <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/too-big-to-deploy-how-gpt-2-is-breaking-production-63ab29f0897c\">serving extremely large models</a>, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 and Google’s <a href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/02/03/google-meena-chatbot-ai-language-model/\">Meena</a>. It’s no coincidence that both of these are natural language models.</li>\\n<li> We’re seeing more and more <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/tns-demo-get-started-with-machine-learning-at-the-edge/\">signs</a> that machine learning and edge computing go together; in fact, that may be the only way that edge computing makes sense. At the O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/oreilly-software-architecture/0636920333777/0636920333777-video329478\">Mary Poppendieck</a> talked about the absurdity of her robotic vacuum cleaner not working during a two-day internet outage. This kind of intelligence needs to be at the edge, rather than in the cloud.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>COVID-19</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li> The Coronavirus is already having a <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-02-foreign-firms-struggle-resume-virus-hit.html\">significant impact</a> on <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-02-apple-revenue-iphone-coronavirus.html\">the economy</a>: shutdown of factories in China and disruption of supply chains is a big deal, even if there isn’t a pandemic.</li>\\n<li> The Coronavirus may present a significant opportunity for educational technology and online education.

We saw that with the FCC and the demise of network neutrality. And I suppose it’s also not a surprise that government sites are particularly open to attack.</li>\\n<li> Another <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-02-intrusion-machine-curiosity-driven-honeypots-cyberattacks.html\">Lidar</a>: this one is an AI-based intrusion detection system for cyberattacks.

API consolidation is interesting in itself, but I’m also interested in it as a step away from text-based programming.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Other trends</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li> Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-02-facebook-zuckerberg-new-style-eu.html\">proposes</a> regulation based on putting appropriate systems in place, not liability for content. This has been criticized as avoiding the real issue, which is the content; but probably the only reasonable way to regulate social media is based around capabilities and systems, rather than individual pieces of content.</li>\\n<li> zsh has been around for a long time without getting a lot of traction, but it may be <a href=\"https://dev.to/danielshow/setting-up-vim-tmux-iterm-and-oh-my-zsh-5e51\">coming out of the shadows</a>. Don’t forget that it’s the default shell in OS X 10.15, replacing bash.</li>\\n<li> DNS may be the most problematic part of Internet infrastructure–and it’s becoming even more problematic with issues like the potential sale of the .org registry. The <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615160/handshake-network-dns-live/\">Handshake Network</a> is a blockchain-based alternative to ICANN’s control of the centralized DNS root registry. A lot of problems have to be solved to make Handshake work, but it sounds to me like a natural application of the blockchain.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/qr_CT36_eOY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

I can&#8217;t resist adding to the outpouring of appreciation and love that has ensued. He has an outsized place in my mind and in my heart for someone whom I met in person fewer than a half-dozen times.</p>\\n<p>When I <a href=\"http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5498\">interviewed Freeman on stage at OSCON in 2004</a>, along with his son George, the subject strayed to digital preservation. I lamented how much would be lost due to incompatible standards for information storage, and he said, &#8220;Oh no, forgetting is so important! It is what gives room for new ideas to come in.&#8221; This was such a typical Freeman moment: bringing a profoundly fresh perspective to any discussion. Perhaps the most famous example is <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.75.486\">the paper he wrote in 1949</a> at the age of 25 making the case that the visualizations of Richard Feynman were mathematically equivalent to the calculations of the more conventional physicists Julian Schwinger and Shin&#8217;ichirō Tomonaga, a paper that led to Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga receiving the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for the theory of quantum electrodynamics.</p>\\n<p>This talent Freeman had for seeing to the heart of things was apparent even earlier, when he was working as a statistician in the operations research section of the Royal Air Force Bomber Command during World War II. As recounted in the first of his numerous volumes of autobiography, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Disturbing-Universe-Sloan-Foundation-Science/dp/0465016774\"><em>Disturbing the Universe</em></a>, he had been asked to study the pattern of bullet holes on the bombers returning to Britain from their forays overseas with an eye to reinforcing the areas with the most anti-aircraft damage. No, no, Freeman argued, reinforcement may be more effective in areas that show little damage in returning planes, because hits to the most vital regions will have caused the planes to be lost! The essential information was to be found in what was missing.</p>\\n<p>After George sent an email to a group of friends about Freeman&#8217;s death, Danny Hillis replied with a story that seems to perfectly encapsulate this gift of Freeman&#8217;s for seeing things that others missed. &#8220;I visited him recently,&#8221; Danny wrote, &#8220;and we got into a conversation about self-organizing systems. After lunch we climbed up the long stairs to his office, and when we sat down he seemed a bit distracted. I asked him what was wrong. Well, he said, what <strong>seemed</strong> wrong was that self-gravitating systems have negative specific heat capacity. The thing to do, he said, was to figure out why that was <strong>right</strong>.&#8221; When the world doesn&#8217;t quite make sense, don&#8217;t brush the offending observations under the rug. Think harder.</p>\\n<p>My earliest memory of Freeman, from well before I met him, echoes the distracted air that Danny noticed. In Kenneth Brower&#8217;s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Starship-Canoe-Kenneth-Brower/dp/0060910305\"><em>The Starship and the Canoe</em></a>, about Freeman&#8217;s work on Project Orion and George&#8217;s work reconstructing early native American canoes in the Pacific Northwest, there was an account of the way Freeman would go so deep inside that he wouldn&#8217;t notice anyone around him—his interior world of thought was too vivid—and how sometimes, he would even break off in the middle of a conversation. Rude? No, he explained (as I recall it). Would someone think it rude if there were the sound of a car accident outside, and you broke off conversation to run to the window? Sometimes thoughts too are so compelling that you must immediately take notice. For those of us who are cursed (or gifted) with the experience that our interior world is sometimes more real than the outside, demanding all our concentration, this was a heady acknowledgement.</p>\\n<p>Another moment that I treasure was a fragment of an overheard conversation at the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp\">Science Foo Camp</a> in 2004. He and another physicist were discussing Michael Crichton&#8217;s novel <em>Prey</em>, in which the monster <em>du jour</em> was a swarm of nanoparticles. He said something like: isn&#8217;t it ridiculous how the nanoparticles are chasing people? Anyone knows that a particle moving in a viscous medium such as air moves at a velocity proportional to its length. (Or some such; I believe he offhandedly referenced a particular formula, which I don&#8217;t recall.) I was immediately struck by how differently the world appears to someone so deeply mathematical. We see the world through the lens of our received ideas, but for most of us, words predominate. Freeman had a gift for seeing with both words and numbers, and for throwing both away when needed, to see the world afresh.</p>\\n<p>Forgetting may be important, but so is remembering and honoring. Freeman was good at that, too. One of my favorite pieces of his writing is his foreword to a collection of Richard Feynman&#8217;s essays, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out-Richard/dp/0465023959/\"><em>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</em></a>. It is so good that over the years, I&#8217;ve managed to get only about halfway through the book, since each time I pick it up, I first re-read Freeman&#8217;s foreword. His account of how he came to write his seminal paper on quantum electrodynamics is the most glorious appreciation of another human being that I have ever read, and shows Freeman at his best: curious, deep, original, humble, kind, thoughtful, and remarkably literary. You can read about Freeman&#8217;s life and career in one of the many obituaries, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/science/freeman-dyson-dead.html\">the one in the <em>New York Times</em></a> last week, but if you want to experience the man himself, you still can, through <a href=\"https://www.sns.ias.edu/sites/default/files/files/Dyson_Bibliography(1).pdf\">the many books and articles he left behind</a>. This is as good <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=WO9D_BaDDhkC&amp;pg=PT6&amp;lpg=PT6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">a place</a> as any to start:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>“I did love the man this side idolatry as much as any,” wrote Elizabethan dramatist Ben Jonson. “The man” was Jonson’s friend and mentor, William Shakespeare. Jonson and Shakespeare were both successful playwrights. Jonson was learned and scholarly, Shakespeare was slapdash and a genius. There was no jealousy between them. Shakespeare was nine years older, already filling the London stage with masterpieces before Jonson began to write. Shakespeare was, as Jonson said, “honest and of an open and free nature,” and gave his young friend practical help as well as encouragement. The most important help that Shakespeare gave was to act one of the leading roles in Jonson’s first play, “Every Man in His Humour,” when it was performed in 1598. The play was a resounding success and launched Jonson’s professional career. Jonson was then aged 25, Shakespeare 34. After 1598, Jonson continued to write poems and plays, and many of his plays were performed by Shakespeare’s company. Jonson became famous in his own right as a poet and scholar, and at the end of his life he was honored with burial in Westminster Abbey. But he never forgot his debt to his old friend. When Shakespeare died, Jonson wrote a poem, “To the Memory of My Beloved Master, William Shakespeare,” containing the well-known lines: “He was not of an age, but for all time.” &#8230;</p>\\n<p>What have Jonson and Shakespeare to do with Richard Feynman? Simply this. I can say as Jonson said, “I did love this man this side idolatry as much as any.” Fate gave me the tremendous luck to have Feynman as a mentor. I was the learned and scholarly student who came from England to Cornell University in 1947 and was immediately entranced by the slapdash genius of Feynman. With the arrogance of youth, I decided that I could play Jonson to Feynman’s Shakespeare. I had not expected to meet Shakespeare on American soil, but I had no difficulty in recognizing him when I saw him.</p>\\n<p>Before I met Feynman, I had published a number of mathematical papers, full of clever tricks but totally lacking in importance. When I met Feynman, I knew at once that I had entered another world. He was not interested in publishing pretty papers. He was struggling, more intensely than I had ever seen anyone struggle, to understand the workings of nature by rebuilding physics from the bottom up&#8230;.I seized every opportunity to listen to Feynman talk, to learn to swim in the deluge of his ideas. He loved to talk, and he welcomed me as a listener. So we became friends for life.</p>\\n<p>For a year I watched as Feynman perfected his way of describing nature with pictures and diagrams, until he had tied down the loose ends and removed the inconsistencies. Then he began to calculate numbers, using his diagrams as a guide. With astonishing speed he was able to calculate physical quantities that could be compared directly with experiment. The experiments agreed with his numbers. In the summer of 1948 we could see Jonson’s words coming true: “Nature herself was proud of his designs, and joyed to wear the dressing of his lines.” During the same year when I was walking and talking with Feynman, I was also studying the work of the physicists Schwinger and Tomonaga, who were following more conventional paths and arriving at similar results. Schwinger and Tomonaga had independently succeeded, using more laborious and complicated methods, in calculating the same quantities that Feynman could derive directly from his diagrams. Schwinger and Tomonaga did not rebuild physics. They took physics as they found it, and only introduced new mathematical methods to extract numbers from the physics. When it became clear that the results of their calculations agreed with Feynman, I knew that I had been given a unique opportunity to bring the three theories together&#8230;. My paper was published in the Physical Review in 1949, and launched my professional career as decisively as “Every Man in His Humour” launched Jonson’s. I was then, like Jonson, 25 years old. Feynman was 31, three years younger than Shakespeare had been in 1598. I was careful to treat my three protagonists with equal dignity and respect, but I knew in my heart that Feynman was the greatest of the three and that the main purpose of my paper was to make his revolutionary ideas accessible to physicists around the world. Feynman actively encouraged me to publish his ideas, and never once complained that I was stealing his thunder. He was the chief actor in my play.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Freeman undersells himself. He too was a genius. We will all miss him.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Freeman Dyson at his 90th birthday celebration at the Institute for Advanced Studies in 2013.\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/FJD-at-90-at-IAS-scaled.jpg\"><figcaption>Freeman Dyson at his 90th birthday celebration at the Institute for Advanced Studies in 2013.

       "     'value': '<p>I read an article on the <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2020/02/03/agile-software-development-dead-deal/\">death of Agile</a>. It&#8217;s not the first article I&#8217;ve seen claiming that Agile is dead, and I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last.</p>\\n<p>The problem with the claim that Agile is &#8220;dead&#8221; is that, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ebenhewitt?lang=en\">Eben Hewitt</a> said to me in a conversation, &#8220;no movement has succeeded until it has become a parody of itself.&#8221; This is a brilliant point that applies perfectly to Agile. What is modern Agile? Fetishizing standups. Fetishizing pair programming. Fetishizing unit testing. Scrum fetishizes working in short, intense bursts. (In the 80s, I worked for a company that had a lot of practices that anticipated Scrum. All I can say is that they were extremely unhealthy. Buy me a beer and I may tell you more.) None of these are bad in and of themselves, but they all miss the point, particularly when they become a ritual. (Standup meetings that are over an hour long? Yep, been invited to those. Refused to attend after the first one.) More often than not, the result of fetishization is—nothing at all. A few existing practices are re-named, a few new rituals are created, and work goes on exactly as it did before—but now it&#8217;s &#8220;agile.&#8221; That kind of Agile needs to die. I won&#8217;t be among the mourners.</p>\\n<p>The one thing I don&#8217;t see, and the one thing that more than anything else captures the value in Agile, is the ongoing conversation between the customer (however that&#8217;s conceived) and the developer. This is important. Agile is not, and never was, about getting developers to write software faster. (Scrum might have been&#8230;) Agile is about getting developers in touch with the people who are the actual users and customers, regularly and repeatedly, so that the project doesn’t inevitably wander off course and produce something (in the words of Douglas Adams) &#8220;almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>I&#8217;m not an Agile fundamentalist, or even a serious Agile evangelist. But it&#8217;s worth some time thinking about the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Agile Manifesto</a> and what it means, maybe even meditating on it. If you were involved with professional programming in the 80s and 90s, you may remember how radical it was (and, in many shops, still is) to put software developers in touch with users and customers. Neckbeards? Geeks and nerds? They might tell the customer that some feature they want is impossible! They might tell the truth! Then what would sales do?</p>\\n<p>Well, it turns out if you want software to work, the developers have to talk to the people who need that software to work. You can&#8217;t leave that to sales people or marketers. You can&#8217;t create a &#8220;product owner&#8221; and say that&#8217;s their job—especially since, more often than not, &#8220;product owners&#8221; don&#8217;t have meaningful contact with customers themselves. (True story: at a former company, a salesperson made a major sale based on a feature that not only couldn&#8217;t possibly be implemented, it didn&#8217;t even make sense. We were very lucky not to be sued.) When a project is going off track because some requirement wasn&#8217;t understood properly, you need to fix that as soon as possible—not after a year-long development process. If Agile&#8217;s first principle is frequent interaction with the customer, its second (and a close corollary) is frequent mid-course corrections. Those mid-course corrections are always less painful than getting to the end and finding that you&#8217;ve built the wrong thing. And that’s a big clue about what the word “Agile” means. It’s not about getting software developers to write code faster. It’s about learning when you need to change direction, and then doing it. It’s about correcting small mistakes before they become big ones, before they’re amplified by a multi-year, multi-million dollar budget.</p>\\n<p>So I really don&#8217;t want to hear that Agile doesn&#8217;t work for large projects and so on. I don&#8217;t care what you call it, but large projects (a) are rarely successful, regardless of the methodology, because they (b) get overloaded with a lot of features that nobody needs but that sound good, and (c) forget what the customer or user really needs or wants. Large projects are necessary, but they have a momentum that tends to drive them off course. Once a project starts going in the wrong direction, it tends to keep going in the wrong direction. That was true before Agile (didn’t Isaac Newton say that?), and will remain true after Agile. Agile provides the tools to keep those projects on track; whether those tools are used, or only get lip service, isn&#8217;t the fault of the methodology.</p>\\n<p>Twenty or so years after the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Agile Manifesto</a> was written, Agile faces a number of challenges. The most important is discovering how to work with data science and artificial intelligence projects. Development timelines for these projects aren&#8217;t as predictable as traditional software; they stretch the meaning of &#8220;testing&#8221; in strange ways; they aren&#8217;t deterministic. Progress in developing software tends to be slow, incremental, and fairly well understood. It&#8217;s reasonable to have something to demo in two weeks (or whatever interval you choose). With AI, you can easily spend months searching for a model—and showing up to one standup meeting after another saying &#8220;ran more experiments, didn&#8217;t make progress,&#8221; until one day it works. (Perhaps the appropriate yardstick for AI projects is the experiment itself, not the code committed to git.)</p>\\n<p>Can Agile work for large teams? Large teams present their own problems, but it&#8217;s ironic to see writers scorning the &#8220;two pizza group&#8221; concept because it can&#8217;t possibly work for large organizations. Do they know where the concept came from? I don&#8217;t know how many lines of code support Amazon&#8217;s core business, or how many software developers work on them, but I am sure that those are very large numbers. But again: value interactions over documentation. Make those interactions possible by dividing the project and keeping the groups small. And you can keep the principle of constant contact with the customer; you just have to be careful about understanding who your customer is, and what they mean. (This has to do with the concept of <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html\">bounded context</a> from Domain Driven Design.)</p>\\n<p>I don’t think Agile is “perfect”; I don&#8217;t even know what &#8220;perfect&#8221; would mean in this context. I do think that Agile, as described in the Manifesto, points to a number of problems that persist in software development, and offers plausible solutions. Sadly, these solutions are more honored in the breach than in the observance; and Eben was right when he said that no methodology has succeeded until it has become a parody of itself. But if Eben is right, then the solution isn’t looking beyond Agile, but becoming self-aware and critical of our own actions. Why, when things change do they remain the same? What are the power struggles, the rewards and punishments, that lie behind the old and new methodologies? When processes change, who wins, who loses, and why? In any organization, answering those questions will say a lot about how Agile becomes self-parody.</p>\\n<p>But really, do you know what it would mean for Agile to succeed? We’d forget about it. We’d just do it. Frequent contact with customers, good in-person communications between team members, along with practices like source control and testing, would just be in the air, like our Wi-Fi networks. We wouldn’t agonize over those practices, or create rituals and ceremonies around them. They’d simply be what we do. <em>— Mike Loukides</em></p>\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Radar data points: Recent research and analysis</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>In &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis/\">5 key areas for tech leaders to watch in 2020</a>,&#8221; we examined search and usage data from the O&#8217;Reilly online learning platform. This data contains notable signals about the trends, topics, and issues tech leaders need to watch and explore.</p>\\n<p>Findings include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Python is preeminent</strong>. It’s the single most popular programming language on O’Reilly, and it accounts for 10% of <em>all</em> usage. This year’s growth in Python usage was buoyed by its increasing popularity among data scientists and machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) engineers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Software architecture, infrastructure, and operations are each changing rapidly</strong>. The shift to cloud native design is transforming both software architecture and infrastructure and operations. Also: <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/infrastructure-ops\">infrastructure and operations</a> is trending up, while DevOps is trending down. Coincidence? Probably not, but only time will tell.</li>\\n<li><strong>ML + AI are up, but passions have cooled</strong>. Up until 2017, the ML+AI topic had been amongst the fastest growing topics on the platform. Growth is still strong for such a large topic, but usage slowed in 2018 (+13%) and cooled significantly in 2019, growing by just 7%. Within the data topic, however, ML+AI has gone from 22% of all usage to 26%.</li>\\n<li><strong>Still cloud-y, but with a possibility of migration</strong>. Strong usage in cloud platforms (+16%) accounted for most cloud-specific growth. But sustained interest in cloud migrations—usage was up almost 10% in 2019, on top of 30% in 2018—gets at another important emerging trend.</li>\\n<li><strong>Security is surging.</strong> Aggregate security usage spiked 26% last year, driven by increased usage for two security certifications: CompTIA Security (+50%) and CompTIA CySA+ (+59%). There’s plenty of security risks for business executives, sysadmins, DBAs, developers, etc., to be wary of.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>We also recently conducted a survey looking at <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-data-quality-in-2020/\">the state of data quality</a>. As we suspected, the topic was brimming with interest—we quickly received more than 1,900 responses to our survey request.</p>\\n<p>Key survey results:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>The C-suite is engaged with data quality.</strong> CxOs, vice presidents, and directors account for 20% of all survey respondents. Data scientists and analysts, data engineers, and the people who manage them comprise 40% of the audience; developers and their managers, about 22%.</li>\\n<li><strong>Data quality might get worse before it gets better. </strong>Comparatively few organizations have created dedicated data quality teams. Just 20% of organizations publish data provenance and data lineage. Most of those who don’t say they have no plans to start.</li>\\n<li><strong>Adopting AI can help data quality.</strong> Almost half (48%) of respondents say they use data analysis, machine learning, or AI tools to address data quality issues. Those respondents are more likely to surface and address latent data quality problems. Can AI be a catalyst for improved data quality?</li>\\n<li><strong>Organizations are dealing with multiple, simultaneous data quality issues</strong>. They have too many different data sources and too much inconsistent data. They don’t have the resources they need to clean up data quality problems. And that’s just the beginning.</li>\\n<li><strong>The building blocks of data governance are often lacking within organizations</strong>. These include the basics, such as metadata creation and management, data provenance, data lineage, and other essentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n<p>Be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/tag/research/\">archive of Radar research and analysis</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/sRQ0tOLD8wo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

This could occur for a myriad of reasons. Perhaps:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><em>You don’t recognize the value of talent</em> that exists in your current workforce. The people are there, but you don’t see them.</li>\\n<li><em>Your workers don’t recognize the value of their talent</em> as it relates to your strategy. The opportunity is there, but they don’t see it.</li>\\n<li><em>Your workers haven’t been sufficiently trained to reach their highest levels</em> of potential when performing their work. They don’t know how to turn raw talent into a competitive capability.</li>\\n<li><em>Your workers haven’t been sufficiently inspired to bring their best talents to work with you</em>, so they are offering them to another organization. In today’s gig economy, that could be devastating for you. That means your people are learning, but you aren’t leveraging them, so someone else is reaping the reward as they grow.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A big part of your leadership success is understanding how to reimagine the way you operate in your own role so that you focus on the organization’s biggest priorities. That will help you know what power to unleash for yourself and what capabilities to foster in others. A good rule of thumb is for you to find the right mix of:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Teaching: coaching and mentoring your people on strategic priorities and using their capabilities correctly</li>\\n<li>Telling: sharing stories, statistics, and strategies about where you’re going, what’s expected, and what’s worked in the past</li>\\n<li>Trusting: delegating work to others so you’ll have time to be far more strategic in your own work efforts</li>\\n<li>Trying: exploring new innovation opportunities as you look for new ways to grow the business or become more efficient</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In order to get untapped talent in your organization to contribute, consider helping your people with 10 key things:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Understanding that you value many different types of talent</strong>Many organizations struggle with identifying and using the talents of their people, so they often don’t know when to use what they have in-house versus investing in outside resources. Before you launch on a large reskilling or outsourcing campaign, start by communicating the value you see in people having a variety of different talents. For instance, instead of focusing on purely technical or business roles, start looking for those people who are great collaborators, those who are great negotiators or deal brokers, those who can visualize enterprise or societal problems, those who are great visionaries, and those who are great orchestrators. You will start to see multiple people step up to new opportunities if you focus on getting the right fit for a person who&#8217;s already in your organization. Remember: just because a person <em>can</em> do a role (which is about capability) doesn’t mean that’s what that person <em>should</em> be doing now (which is about fit). Look at people’s experiences, competencies, capabilities, and interests as they all relate to your current business needs. Then validate various types of talent so you can draw on all of them to fulfill your strategic priorities.</li>\\n<li><strong>Accurately assessing their potential</strong>Organizations can sometimes struggle with two distinct types of people. One group is full of very talented individuals, but they do not understand how and why their talent is valuable to the organization’s strategy. They know how to fulfill the requirements of their job description, but they are unable to connect their work back to the broader success of the business. The second group is also comprised of talented individuals, but in this case, they know their experiences and capabilities, and they’re able to make connections to creative opportunities for their talent in countless ways. Their challenge lies in the fact that you don’t see their potential. You’re so accustomed to seeing people one way that you can’t see the forest for the trees. Learn to be more intentional and inclusionary in the way you assess team members and apply their skills to your overall goals.</li>\\n<li><strong>Using multiple approaches to match talent to work</strong>Typically, organizations look at their strategy first and then try to find the talent and capabilities that give them a competitive advantage. One alternative is to assess the existing talent you have in your organization, and then, given that talent, ask yourself what you might be able to produce. Consider case #1, where you might contemplate building a new system. You identify a need for new architects, coders, infrastructure team members, etc. Now consider case #2, where you still evaluate your entire team, but find that in addition to architects, coders, and infrastructure team members, you have artists, communicators, historians, security experts, gamers, and even digital laggards. Given your team makeup and your customers’ needs, ask yourself what kind of solutions you could offer if you have all of those skills at your disposal. There is a vast array of offerings waiting to be exposed by the untapped capabilities of your team.</li>\\n<li><strong>Making it exciting to do something different</strong>Your people have taken a long time to build their reputations, so occasionally you may find that some of them are reluctant to step out into a new role. In order to help them take the risk to use hidden talents in new ways, generate some energy around the effort you’re offering. Create a buzz in the office that makes this a hot opportunity, one that everyone wants to be involved in. By promoting the project and whipping up enthusiasm both inside and outside your team, you can emphasize cool new opportunities and roles that those who sign on will be building something bigger than themselves, a project so rewarding they won&#8217;t want to miss out.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branding their work in new ways</strong>Start to think about your work more abstractly, and teach your direct reports to think that way as well. For instance, instead of looking at your group as an infrastructure team responsible for setting up servers, give your team a tagline that brands their efforts in an abstract, yet inventive way. For instance, migrate their thinking about their job from pure infrastructure work to “helping the organization move at the speed of light.” This becomes a simple, yet powerful reminder that you are no longer doing business as usual, and new skills are required to help you be successful. People will naturally start to determine ways they can use their hidden talent to help the organization move faster, they’ll start to have different conversations with their colleagues, and you will see innovative solutions that wouldn’t occur with your normal modes of working.</li>\\n<li><strong>Creating multiple ways to become a rock star</strong>Recognize that most people won’t move on to lead departments or huge numbers of people. Create paths where talent can grow and be recognized because of their deep knowledge and collaborative efforts, even if they don’t request or receive a promotion. Develop “Unsung Hero” awards for those who work behind the scenes to make everything run smoothly. Recognize individual players who develop solutions as well as those who have become the glue that holds everything together, and recognize those who develop ideas on the fringe to help you work through a really tough delivery.</li>\\n<li><strong>Creating a culture where it’s easy for people to speak up</strong>We often ask people to speak up, but then force them to work in cultures where it’s virtually impossible for them to actually do it. That creates an environment where most of your employees are not their best versions of themselves every day. They’ve learned that it’s smart to be quiet, even when they have knowledge that might help you win. People may see opportunities you can capitalize on, capabilities they could offer, or competitive advantage they could create, but because of the way your culture works, they’ve learned to be quiet. They cage those thoughts within because they do not have a voice, or they are not allowed to have vision on your team. Demonstrate the value of every person’s contribution by intentionally creating space (in meetings, in email, at the watercooler, etc.) for everyone to develop influence on the team.</li>\\n<li><strong>Making it easy and okay for people to build coalitions of support</strong>Allow team members to reach out to others in the company who think and act like them, or who are interested in the same subject matters. Provide an autonomous environment where they can pursue their ambitions with others. These places can serve as incubators for ideas and sandboxes for new innovation. You’ll see new opportunities emerge as people collaborate to solve problems, or start to recognize commonality in roles and processes. Instead of stifling these conversations, encourage them, because they are a sign that a coalition is forming and your productivity could soon be rising.</li>\\n<li><strong>Bringing a strategic focus to their work</strong>Rather than focusing on a job description, help team members understand the real job to be done, and recognize that their future work might be performed in a different way than their work is completed today. Give them a mission, a vision, a way to fit in to the overall strategic priorities of the business. Help them find a dream that is strong enough for them to take ownership of known and unknown tasks and want to individually push them forward. Give them time to develop capabilities today that you know you’ll need tomorrow. But then stick to your word. Often, people are promised the moon when they take on a job and then find themselves stuck working in the basement. This can lead to enormous levels of disengagement because, while employees still have to do the work, they have no real outlet for their innovation. That will force them to look elsewhere to solve their problem.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rethinking your own work and ways of working</strong>Go back to the drawing board for your own role. Understand what your real work is. Often, as people stay with an organization, the <em>work</em> changes, but they don’t change the <em>way they work</em>. You might be doing different work today than you did a few years ago, but your thought processes and work patterns can be essentially the same. Step back and take a look at your current role. What you are trying to accomplish, and who will you need for support in that effort? Are you doing the right work? Are you intentional about the way you use the time you spend with your leaders, peers, and directs? How do you use the mix of your time? How do you use their time?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>By using these 10 techniques, you will be able to harness the power of your organization’s untapped talent, capitalize on your people’s capabilities, and create a culture that motivates them to partner with you to create long-term success for your organization.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/aiL68-Q073I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

It’s the single most popular programming language on O’Reilly, and it accounts for 10% of <em>all</em> usage. This year’s growth in Python usage was buoyed by its increasing popularity among data scientists and machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) engineers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Software architecture, infrastructure, and operations are each changing rapidly</strong>. The shift to cloud native design is transforming both software architecture and infrastructure and operations. Also: <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/infrastructure-ops\">infrastructure and operations</a> is trending up, while DevOps is trending down. Coincidence? Probably not, but only time will tell.</li>\\n<li><strong>ML + AI are up, but passions have cooled</strong>. Up until 2017, the ML+AI topic had been amongst the fastest growing topics on the platform. Growth is still strong for such a large topic, but usage slowed in 2018 (+13%) and cooled significantly in 2019, growing by just 7%. Within the data topic, however, ML+AI has gone from 22% of all usage to 26%.</li>\\n<li><strong>Still cloud-y, but with a possibility of migration</strong>. Strong usage in cloud platforms (+16%) accounted for most cloud-specific growth. But sustained interest in cloud migrations—usage was up almost 10% in 2019, on top of 30% in 2018—gets at another important emerging trend.</li>\\n<li><strong>Security is surging.</strong> Aggregate security usage spiked 26% last year, driven by increased usage for two security certifications: CompTIA Security (+50%) and CompTIA CySA+ (+59%). There’s plenty of security risks for business executives, sysadmins, DBAs, developers, etc., to be wary of.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/1-top-search-terms.png\" alt=\"Normalized search frequency of top terms on the O’Reilly online learning platform in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each term (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 1 (above).

Python-related usage grew at a solid 6% pace in 2019, a slight drop from 2018 (+10%). After several years of steady climbing—and after outstripping Java in 2017—Python-related interactions now comprise almost 10% of all usage.</p>\\n<p>But Python is a special case: this year, more than in year’s past, its growth was buoyed by interest in ML. Usage specific to Python as a programming language grew by just 4% in 2019; by contrast, usage that had to do with Python and ML—be it in the context of AI, deep learning, and natural language processing, or in combination with any of several popular ML/AI frameworks—grew by 9%. The laggard use case was Python-based web development frameworks, which grew by just 3% in usage, year over year.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/3-top-languages-search.png\" alt=\"Normalized search frequency of top programming languages on the O’Reilly online learning platform in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each language (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 3 (above). Normalized search frequency of top programming languages on the O’Reilly online learning platform in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each language (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/4-top-languages-usage.png\" alt=\"Programming languages on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each language (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 4. Programming languages on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each language (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>This is consistent with <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/whats-driving-open-source-software-in-2019/\">what we’ve observed elsewhere</a>: Python has acquired new relevance amid strong interest in AI and ML. Along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)\">R</a>, Python is one of the most-used languages for data analysis. From pre-built libraries for linear or logistic regressions, decision trees, naïve Bayes, k-means, gradient-boosting, etc., there’s a Python library for virtually anything a developer or data scientist might need to do. (Python libraries are no less useful for manipulating or engineering data, too.)</p>\\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0212jm\">R itself continues to decline</a>. R-related usage on O’Reilly online learning fell by 8% between 2017-18 and by 6%, year-over-year, in 2019. It’s likely that R—much like Scala (-33% in usage in 2018-19; -19% in usage 2017-18)—is a casualty of Python. True, it might seem difficult to reconcile R’s decline with strong interest in AI and ML, but consider two factors: first, ML and statistics are not the same thing, and, second, R is not, primarily, a developer-oriented language. R was designed for use in academic, scientific, and, more recently, commercial use cases. As statistics and related techniques become more important in software development, more programmers are encountering stats in programming classes. In this context, they’re more likely to use Python than R.</p>\\n<p>Interest in some languages seems to be trending up, and interest in others, down. Exhibit A: Java-related usage dropped by a noteworthy 13% between 2018 and 2019. Is this the harbinger of a trend? Not necessarily: Java-related searches increased by 5% between 2017 and 2018. On the other hand, Java’s cousin, JavaScript, also appears to be in decline. True, theirs is only a conceptual relation, but interest in JavaScript, too, <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F02p97\">really does seem to be waning</a>: JS-related usage dropped on O’Reilly online learning by 4% between 2017-2018 and by 7% between 2018-19. It’s possible that microservices architecture is hastening the move to other languages (such as Go, Rust, and Python) for web properties.</p>\\n<p>Among the JavaScript-based web application frameworks, React gained in popularity (+4% in usage) as Angular (-12% in usage) slipped between 2018 and 2019. Vue.js—a competitor to both React and Angular—settled down to steady growth (+8% in usage) in 2018-19, after almost doubling in usage (+97%) between 2017-18.</p>\\n<p id=\"F2\">One possible trend-in-the-making is that of a slowing Go, which—following several years of rapid growth in usage (including +14% from 2017 to 2018)—cooled down last year, with usage growing by a mere 2%. But Go is now the sixth most-used programming language, trailing only Python, Java, .NET, and C++. Drop .NET from the tally on methodological grounds<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and Go cracks the top five.</p>\\n<h2>Trends in software architecture, infrastructure, and operations</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/how-companies-adopt-and-apply-cloud-native-infrastructure/\">Cloud native</a><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/how-companies-adopt-and-apply-cloud-native-infrastructure/\"> design</a> is a new way of thinking about software and architecture. But the shift to cloud native has implications not only for <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-topics-to-watch-in-software-architecture/\">software architecture</a><u>,</u> but for <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/infrastructure-ops/io-ca\">infrastructure and operations</a>, too. It exploits new design patterns (microservices) and adapts existing techniques (service orchestration) with the goal of achieving cloud-like elasticity and resilience in <em>all</em> environments, cloud or on-premises. O’Reilly Radar uses the term “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-is-next-architecture/\">Next Architecture</a><u>”</u> to describe this shift.</p>\\n<p>It’s against this backdrop that what’s happening in both software architecture and infrastructure and ops must be understood. In the generic software architecture topic, usage in the containers topic increased in our 2019 analysis, growing by 17%. This was just a fraction of its 2018 growth rate (+56% in usage), but impressive nonetheless. Kubernetes has emerged as the <em>de facto</em> solution for orchestrating services and microservices in cloud native design patterns. Usage in Kubernetes surged by 211% in 2018—and grew at a 40% clip in 2019. Kubernetes’ parent topic, container orchestrators, also posted strong usage growth: 151% in 2018, 36% this year—almost all due to interest in Kubernetes itself.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/5-software-architecture-usage-e1581084431270.png\" alt=\"Software architecture topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 5. Software architecture topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>This also helps explain increased usage in the microservices topic, which grew at a 22% clip in 2019. True, you don’t necessarily <em>need</em> microservices to “do” cloud native design; at this point, however, it’s difficult to disentangle the two. Most cloud native design patterns involve microservices.</p>\\n<p>These trends are also implicated in the rise of infrastructure and ops, which reflects both the limitations of DevOps and the challenges posed by the shift to cloud native design. Infrastructure and ops usage was the fastest growing sub-topic under the generic systems administration topic. Surging interest in infrastructure and ops also explains declining usage in the configuration management (CM) and DevOps topic areas. The most popular CM tools are DevOps focused, and, like DevOps itself, they’re declining: usage in the CM topic dropped significantly (-18%) in 2019, as did virtually all CM tools. Ansible was least affected (-4% in usage), but Jenkins, Puppet, Chef, and Salt each dropped off by 25% or more in usage. It can’t be a coincidence that DevOps usage declined again (-5%) in 2019, following a 20% decline in 2018.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/6-infrastructure-ops-usage-e1581084489821.png\" alt=\"Infrastructure and operations topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 6. Infrastructure and operations topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The emergence of infrastructure and ops suggests that organizations might be having trouble <em>scaling</em> DevOps. DevOps aims to produce programmers who can work competently in each of the layers in a system “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=461505383919\">stack</a>.” In practice, however, developers tend to be less committed to DevOps’ operations component, a fact that gave birth to the idea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering\">site reliability engineering</a> (SRE). Even if the “full stack” developer isn’t a unicorn, she certainly isn’t commonplace. Organizations see infrastructure and ops as a pragmatic, ops-focused complement that picks up precisely where DevOps tends to fail.</p>\\n<h2>A drill-down into data, AI, and ML topics</h2>\\n<p>The results for data-related topics are both predictable and—there’s no other way to put it—confusing. Starting with data engineering, the backbone of all data work (the category includes titles covering data management, i.e., relational databases, Spark, Hadoop, SQL, NoSQL, etc.). In aggregate, data engineering usage declined 8% in 2019. This follows a 3% drop in 2018. Both years were driven by declining usage of data management titles.</p>\\n<p>When we look more specifically at data engineering topics, <em>excluding</em> data management, we see a small share, but solid growth in usage, up 7% in 2018 and 15% in 2019 (see Figure 7).</p>\\n<p>Within the broad “data” topic, data engineering (including data management) continues as the topic with the most share, garnering about one-twelfth of all usage on the platform. This is almost double the usage share of the data science topic, which recorded an uptick in usage (+5%) in 2019, following a decline (-2%) in 2018.</p>\\n<p>Elsewhere, interest in ML and AI keeps growing, albeit at a diminished rate. To wit: the combined ML/AI topic was up 7% in usage in 2019, about half its growth (+13%) in 2018.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/7-data-usage-e1581084542209.png\" alt=\"Data topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 7. Data topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Ironically, the strength of ML/AI might be less evident in data-specific topics than in other topic areas, such as programming languages, where growing Python usage is—to a large degree—being driven by that language’s usefulness for and applicability to ML. But ML/AI-related topics such as natural language processing (NLP, +22% in 2019) and neural networks (+17%) recorded strong growth in usage, too.</p>\\n<p id=\"F3\">Data engineering <em>as a task</em> certainly isn’t in decline. Interest in data engineering probably isn’t declining, either. If anything, data engineering <em>as a practice area</em> is being subsumed by both data science and ML/AI<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. We know from <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-data-quality-in-2020/\">other research</a> that data scientists, ML and AI engineers, etc., spend an outsized proportion of their time discovering, preparing, and engineering data for their work. We’ve seen that popular tools and frameworks usually incorporate data engineering capabilities, either in the form of automated/guided self-service features or (in the case of Jupyter and other notebooks) an ability to build and orchestrate data engineering pipelines that invoke Python, R (via Python), etc., libraries to run data engineering jobs concurrently or, if possible, in parallel.</p>\\n<p>Terms that correspond with old-school data engineering—e.g., “relational database,” “Oracle database solutions,” “Hive,” “database administration,” “data models,” “Spark”—declined in usage, year-over-year, in 2019. Some of this decline was a function of larger, market-driven factors. We know from our research that Hadoop and its ecosystem of related projects (such as Hive) <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics-to-watch-at-the-strata-data-conference-in-new-york-2019/\">are in the midst of a protracted, years-long decline</a>. This decline is borne out in our usage numbers: Hadoop (-34%), Hive (also -34%), and even Spark (-21%) were all down, significantly, year-over-year.</p>\\n<p>We discuss likely reasons for this decline in more detail <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics-to-watch-at-the-strata-data-conference-in-new-york-2019/\">in our analysis of O’Reilly Strata Conference speaker proposals</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Cloud continuing to climb</h2>\\n<p>Interest in cloud-related concepts and terms continues to increase on O’Reilly online learning, albeit at a slower rate. Cloud-related usage surged by 35% between 2017 and 2018; it grew at less than half that rate (17%) between 2018 and 2019. This slowdown suggests that cloud as a category has achieved such a large share that (mathematically) any additional growth <em>must</em> occur at a slower rate. In cloud’s case, while growth is slower, it’s still strong.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/8-cloud-usage-e1581084605868.png\" alt=\"Cloud topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).\"><figcaption>Figure 8. Cloud topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right).</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Interest in cloud service provider platforms mirrors that of the industry as a whole: Amazon and AWS-related usage increased by 14%, year-over-year; Azure usage, on the other hand, grew at a speedier 29% clip, while Google Compute Platform (GCP) surged by 39%. Amazon controls a little less than half (<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018\">per Gartner’s 2018 numbers</a>) of the overall market for cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings. It, too, has reached the point at which rapid growth becomes mathematically prohibitive. Both Azure and GCP are growing much faster than AWS, but they’re also much smaller: Azure notched nearly 61% growth in 2018 (per Gartner), good for more than 15% of the IaaS market; GCP, at around 60% growth, accounts for 4% of IaaS share.</p>\\n<p>Also intriguing: cloud-specific interest in microservices and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a> grew significantly last year on O’Reilly. Microservices-related usage was up 22%, year over year, following a decline in 2018. Kubernetes usage was up by 38%, year over year, following a period of explosive growth (+190%) from 2017 to 2018. Both trends mirror what we’re seeing via user surveys and other <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/tag/research/\">research efforts</a>: namely, that microservices has emerged as an important component of cloud native design and development.</p>\\n<p>The bigger takeaway is that the essential tendency of modern software architecture—namely, the priority it gives to loose coupling in emphasizing abstraction, isolation, and atomicity—is eliding the boundaries between what we think of as “cloud” versus “on-premises” contexts. We see this via sustained interest in microservices and Kubernetes in both on-premises <em>and</em> cloud deployments.</p>\\n<p>This is the logic of cloud native design: specific deployment contexts will still matter, of course—which features or constraints do developers need to take into account when they’re developing for AWS? For Azure? For GCP? But the clear boundaries that used to demarcate the public cloud from the private cloud are starting to disappear, just as those that distinguish on-premises private clouds from conventional on-premises systems are falling away, too.</p>\\n<h2>Surging interest in security</h2>\\n<p>Security usage (+26%) grew significantly in 2019 (see Figure 2). Some of this was driven by increased usage in the CompTIA Security+ (50%) and CompTIA Cyber Security Analyst (CySA+, 59%) topics.</p>\\n<p>Security+ is an entry-level security certification, so its growth could be attributed to increased usage by sysadmins, DBAs, software developers, and other non-specialists. Whether it’s to flesh out their full-stack bona fides, address new job (or <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181.pdf?trackDocs=NIST.SP.800-181.pdf\">regulatory</a>) requirements, or simply to make themselves more marketable, Security+ is a pretty straightforward certification process: pass the exam and you’re certified. CySA+, on the other hand, is relatively new. This <em>could</em> explain the explosion of CySA+-related usage in 2018 (+128%), as well as last year’s strong growth. Unlike <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_security_certifications\">the CISSP and other popular certifications</a>, CySA+ recommends, but doesn’t require, real-world experience. Like Security+, it’s another certification sys admins, DBAs, developers, and others can pick up to burnish their bona fides.</p>\\n<p>Certifications weren’t the only thing driving security-related usage on O’Reilly in 2019. A rash of vulnerabilities and potential exploits, too, had some impact. If 2018 (+5% growth in security usage; +22% growth in search) gave us <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)\">Meltdown</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)\">Spectre</a>, 2019 gave us sobering information about <a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/security/spectre-making-comeback-processors/\">the far-reaching </a><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/security/spectre-making-comeback-processors/\"><em>implications</em></a><a href=\"https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/security/spectre-making-comeback-processors/\"> of Meltdown</a> and, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612989/chips-may-be-inherently-vulnerable-to-spectre-and-meltdown-attacks/\">especially, Spectre</a>. For 2019, security-specific usage (+26%) and search (+25%) increased accordingly. System and database administrators, CSAs, CISSPs, and others were keen to acquire expert, detailed information specific to patching and hardening their vulnerable systems to protect against <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05441.pdf\">no less than 13 different Spectre and 14 different Meltdown variants</a>, as well as to mitigate <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=spec-melt-8way&amp;num=1\">the potentially huge performance impacts associated with these patches</a>. Developers and software architects had questions about rewriting, refactoring, or optimizing their code to address these same concerns. Against this backdrop, the spike in security-related usage makes sense.</p>\\n<p>There was a great deal going on with respect to information security and data privacy, too. After all, not only was 2019 the first full year for which the EU’s omnibus GDPR regime was binding, but—as of January 1, 2019—updates to Canada’s GDPR-like PIPEDA regime officially kicked in, too. The sweeping <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA), which has been called California’s GDPR, went into effect on January 1, &nbsp;2020.</p>\\n<p>Taken together, an analysis of these trends seems to support a glass-half-full assessment of the state of security today. If the sustained growth in security usage on O’Reilly is a reliable indicator, it’s <em>possible</em> that security may, finally, be getting the attention it deserves in an increasingly digital world. It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that organizations have accepted that the financial and reputational penalties entailed by a data breach or high-profile hack are just too costly to risk, and that money spent on information security is, on balance, money well spent.</p>\\n<p>The same analysis also lends itself to a glass-half-empty assessment, however: namely, that security spending is cyclical; that a confluence of circumstances has helped to boost security spending; and that—let’s be honest—<a href=\"https://www.varonis.com/blog/company-reputation-after-a-data-breach/\">organizations tend to bounce back from high-profile security incidents</a>. Only time (or future installments of this survey) will tell.</p>\\n<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\\n<p>It’s hard to imagine that the hottest trends of 2019 won’t be reprising their roles, in more or less the same pecking order, in next year’s analysis. Programming languages come into and go out of vogue, but Python appears poised to keep growing at a steady rate because it’s at once protean, adaptable, and easy to use. We see this in the widespread use of Python in ML and AI, where it has supplanted R as the <em>lingua franca</em> of data engineering and analysis.</p>\\n<p>The same is true of ML and AI. Even if (as some naysayers warn) the next <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter\">AI winter</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47111fce-d0a4-11e8-9a3c-5d5eac8f1ab4\">is nigh upon us</a>, it’s hard to imagine interest in ML and AI petering out anytime soon. The same could be said about trends in software architecture and, especially, infrastructure and operations. They’re each sites of ceaseless innovation. Their practitioners will be hard-pressed to keep up with what’s happening.</p>\\n<p>It’s helpful to think of what’s hot and what’s not in terms of a modified “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">Overton Window</a>.” The Overton Window circumscribes the <em>human cognitive bandwidth</em> that’s available in a certain place at a certain time. No combination of policies—or issues, or trends—can exceed more than 100% of available bandwidth. This is true, to a degree, of the activity on O’Reilly online learning, too. A decline in usage doesn’t have to correlate with a decline in use (or usefulness) in practice. It’s just being crowded out by other, emergent trends.</p>\\n<p>This also underscores why the decline in a bellwether topic such as JavaScript might be hugely significant. Even if these topics are no longer sites of rapid and sustained innovation, they are likewise important for day-to-day use cases, especially with respect to general-purpose information-gathering or more specialized problem solving. It isn’t that JavaScript is less important than it used to be; after all, React, Angular, and Vue.js are sites of development and innovation, and all three are based on JavaScript. It’s that we’re coming to understand and relate to JavaScript—or data engineering, or Docker, or DevOps and change management—in a different way. We’re appropriating them differently.</p>\\n<p>It’s this difference that Radar aims to capture. Not the change that’s obvious for everyone to see, but the coalescence of change itself as it’s happening.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<p id=\"_ftn1\"><a href=\"#F1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This article is based on non-personally-identifiable information about the top search terms and most-used topics on O’Reilly online learning.

Those suspicions were confirmed when we quickly received more than 1,900 responses to our mid-November survey request. The responses show a surfeit of concerns around data quality and some uncertainty about how best to address those concerns.</p>\\n<p>Key survey results:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>The C-suite is engaged with data quality.</strong> CxOs, vice presidents, and directors account for 20% of all survey respondents. Data scientists and analysts, data engineers, and the people who manage them comprise 40% of the audience; developers and their managers, about 22%.</li>\\n<li><strong>Data quality might get worse before it gets better. </strong>Comparatively few organizations have created dedicated data quality teams. Just 20% of organizations publish data provenance and data lineage. Most of those who don’t say they have no plans to start.</li>\\n<li><strong>Adopting AI can help data quality.</strong> Almost half (48%) of respondents say they use data analysis, machine learning, or AI tools to address data quality issues. Those respondents are more likely to surface and address latent data quality problems. Can AI be a catalyst for improved data quality?</li>\\n<li><strong>Organizations are dealing with multiple, simultaneous data quality issues</strong>. They have too many different data sources and too much inconsistent data. They don’t have the resources they need to clean up data quality problems. And that’s just the beginning.</li>\\n<li><strong>The building blocks of data governance are often lacking within organizations</strong>. These include the basics, such as metadata creation and management, data provenance, data lineage, and other essentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The top-line good news is that people at all levels of the enterprise seem to be alert to the importance of data quality. The top-line bad news is that organizations aren’t doing enough to address their data quality issues. They’re making do with inadequate—or non-existent—controls, tools, and practices. They’re still struggling with the basics: tagging and labeling data, creating (and managing) metadata, managing unstructured data, etc.</p>\\n<h2>Respondent demographics</h2>\\n<h3>Analysts and engineers predominate</h3>\\n<p>Nearly one-quarter of respondents work as data scientists or analysts (see Figure 1). An additional 7% are data engineers. On top of this, close to 8% manage data scientists or engineers. That means that about 40% of the sample consists of front-line practitioners. This is hardly surprising. Analysts and data engineers are, arguably, the people who work most closely with data.</p>\\n<p>In practice, however, almost every data scientist and analyst also doubles as a data engineer: she spends a significant proportion of her time locating, preparing, and cleaning up data for use in analysis. In this way, data scientists and data analysts arguably have a personal stake in data quality. They’re often the first to surface data quality problems; in organizations that do not have dedicated data quality teams (or analogous resources, such as data quality centers of excellence), analysts play a leading role in cleaning up and correcting data quality issues, too.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-1.png\" alt=\"Roles of survey respondents\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Roles of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>A switched-on C-suite?</h3>\\n<p>Respondents who work in upper management—i.e., as directors, vice presidents, or CxOs—constitute a combined one-fifth of the sample. This is surprising. These results suggest that data quality has achieved salience of some kind in the minds of upper-level management. But what kind of salience? That’s a tricky question.</p>\\n<p>Role-wise, the survey sample is dominated by (1) practitioners who work with data and/or code and (2) the people who directly manage them—most of whom, notionally, also have backgrounds in data and/or code. This last point is important. A person who manages a data science or data engineering team—or, for that matter, a DevOps or AIOps practice—functions for all intents and purposes as an interface between her team(s) and the person (also typically a manager) to whom she directly reports. She’s “management,” but she’s still at the front line. And she likely also groks the practical, logistical, and political issues that (in their intersectionality) combine to make data quality such a thorny problem.</p>\\n<p>Executives bring a different, <em>transcendent</em>, perspective to bear in assessing data quality, particularly with respect to its impact on business operations and strategy. Executives see the big picture, not only vis-à-vis operations and strategy, but also with respect to problems—and, especially, <em>complaints</em>—in the units that report to them. Executive buy-in and support is usually seen as one of the pillars of any successful data quality program because data quality is more a people-and-process-laden problem than a technological one. It isn’t just that different groups have differing standards, expectations, or priorities when it comes to data quality; it’s that different groups will <em>go to war</em> over these standards, expectations, and priorities. Data quality solutions almost always boil down to two big issues: politics and cost. Some group(s) are going to have to change the way they do things; the money to pay for data quality improvements must come out of this or that group’s budget.</p>\\n<p>Executive interest can be a useful—if not infallible—proxy for an organization’s posture with respect to data quality. Historically, the executive who understood the importance of data quality was an exception, with few enlightened CxOs spearheading data quality initiatives or helping kick-start a data quality center of excellence. Whether due to organizations becoming more data driven, or the increased attention paid to the effects of data quality on AI efforts, increased C-suite buy-in is a positive development.</p>\\n<h2>Organizational demographics</h2>\\n<p>About half of survey respondents are based in North America. Slightly more than a quarter are in Europe—inclusive of the United Kingdom—while about one-sixth are in Asia. Combined, respondents in South America and the Middle East account for just under 10% of the survey sample.</p>\\n<p>Drilling down deeper, almost two-fifths of the survey audience works in tech-laden verticals such as software, consulting/professional services, telcos, and computers/hardware (Figure 2). This <em>could</em> impart a slight tech bias to the results. On the other hand, between 5% and 10% of respondents work in each of a broad swath of other verticals, including: healthcare, government, higher education, and retail/e-commerce. (“Other,” the second largest category, with about 15% of respondents, encompasses more than a dozen other verticals.) So concern about tech-industry bias could be offset by the fact that virtually all industries are, in effect, tech-dependent.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-2.png\" alt=\"Industries of survey respondents\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 2. Industries of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Size-wise, there’s a good mix in the survey base: nearly half of respondents work in organizations with 1,000 employees or more; slightly more than half, at organizations with 1,000 employees or less.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-3.png\" alt=\"Organization size\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 3. Organization size.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h2>Data quality issues and affects</h2>\\n<p>We asked respondents to select from among a list of common data quality problems. Respondents were encouraged to select all issues that apply to them (Figure 4).</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-4-e1580931638152-1048x587.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: Data quality survey 20. Primary data quality issues faced by respondents’ organizations.\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 4. Primary data quality issues faced by respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Too many data sources, too little consistency</h3>\\n<p>By a wide margin, respondents rate the sheer preponderance of data sources as the single most common data quality issue. More than 60% of respondents selected “Too many data sources and inconsistent data,” followed by “Disorganized data stores and lack of metadata,” which was selected by just under 50% of respondents (Figure 4).</p>\\n<p>There’s something else to think about, too. This was a select-all-that-apply-type question, which means that you’d expect to see some inflation for the very first option on the list, i.e., “Poorly labeled data,” which was selected by just under 44% of respondents. Choosing the first item in a select-all-that-apply list is a human behavior statisticians have learned to expect and (if necessary) to control for.</p>\\n<p>But “Poorly labeled data” was actually the fifth most common problem, trailing not only the issues above, but “Poor data quality controls at data entry” (selected by close to 47%) and “Too few resources available to address data quality issues” (selected by less than 44%), as well. On the other hand, the combination of “Poorly labeled data” and “Unlabeled data” tallies close to 70%.</p>\\n<p>There’s good and bad in this. First, the bad: reducing the number of data sources is hard.</p>\\n<p>IT fought the equivalent of a rear-guard action against this very problem through most of the 1990s and 2000s. Data management practitioners even coined a term—“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadmart\">spreadmart</a> hell”—to describe what happens when several different individuals or groups maintain spreadsheets of the same data set. The self-service use case helped exacerbate this problem: the first generation of self-service data analysis tools eschewed features (such as metadata creation and management, provenance/lineage tracking, and data synchronization) that are essential for data quality and good data governance.</p>\\n<p>In other words, the sheer preponderance of data sources isn’t a bug: it’s a feature. If history is any indication, it’s a problem that isn’t going to go away: multiple, redundant, sometimes inconsistent copies of useful data sets will always be with us.</p>\\n<p>On the good side, technological progress—e.g., front-end tools that generate metadata and capture provenance and lineage; data cataloging software that manages provenance and lineage—could tamp down on this. So, too, could cultural transformation: e.g., a top-down push to educate people about data quality, data governance, and general data literacy.</p>\\n<h3>Organizations are flunking Data Governance 101</h3>\\n<p>Some common data quality issues point to larger, institutional problems. “Disorganized data stores and lack of metadata” is fundamentally a governance issue. But just 20% of survey respondents say their organizations publish information about data provenance or data lineage, which—along with robust metadata—are essential tools for diagnosing and resolving data quality issues. If the management of data provenance/lineage is taken as a proxy for good governance, few organizations are making the cut. Nor is it surprising that so many respondents also cite unlabeled/poorly labeled data as a problem. You can’t fake good governance.</p>\\n<p>Still another hard problem is that of “Poor data quality controls at data entry.” Anyone who has worked with data knows that data entry issues are persistent and endemic, if not intractable.</p>\\n<p>Some other common data quality issues (Figure 4)—e.g., poor data quality from third-party sources (cited by about 36% of respondents), missing data (about 37%), and unstructured data (more than 40%)—are less insidious, but no less frustrating. Practitioners may have little or no control over providers of third-party data. Missing data will always be with us—as will an institutional reluctance to make it whole. As for a lack of resources (cited by more than 40% of respondents), there’s at least some reason for hope: machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a bit of a boost. Data engineering and data analysis tools use ML to simplify and substantively automate some of the tasks involved in discovering, profiling, and indexing data.</p>\\n<p>Not surprisingly, almost half (48%) of respondents say they use data analysis, machine learning, or AI tools to address data quality issues. A deeper dive (Figure 5) provides an interesting take: organizations that have dedicated data quality teams use analytic and AI tools at a higher rate, 59% compared to the 42% of respondents from organizations with no dedicated data quality team. Having a team focused on data quality can provide the space and motivation to invest in trying and learning tools that make the team more productive. Few data analysts or data engineers have the time or capacity to make that commitment, instead relying on ad hoc methods to address the data quality issues they face.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-9-e1580932248483-1048x482.png\" alt=\"Figure 5: Data quality survey \\'20. Effect of dedicated data quality team on using AI tools.\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 5. Effect of dedicated data quality team on using AI tools.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>That being said, data quality, like data governance, is fundamentally a socio-technical problem. ML and AI can help to an extent, but it’s incumbent on the organization itself to make the necessary people and process changes. After all, people and processes are almost always implicated in both the creation and the <em>perpetuation </em>of data quality issues. Ultimately, diagnosing and resolving data quality problems requires a genuine commitment to governance.</p>\\n<p>Data conditioning is expensive and resource intensive (and decidedly not sexy), one of the reasons we don’t see more formal support for data quality amongst respondents. To increase the focus on resolving data issues requires carefully scrutinizing the ROI of data conditioning efforts to focus on the most worthwhile, productive, and effective efforts.</p>\\n<h3>Biases, damned biases, and missing data</h3>\\n<p>Just under 20% of respondents cited “Biased data” as a primary data quality issue (Figure 4). We often talk about the need to address bias and fairness in data. But here the evidence suggests that respondents see bias as less problematic than other common data quality issues. Do they know something we don’t? Or are respondents themselves biased—in this case, by what they can’t imagine? This result underscores the importance of acknowledging that data contains biases; that we should assume (not rule out) the existence of unknown biases; and that we should promote the development of formal diversity (cognitive, cultural, socio-economic, physical, background, etc.) and processes to detect, acknowledge, and address those biases.</p>\\n<p>Missing data plays into this, too. It isn’t just that we lack the data we believe we need for the work we want to do. Sometimes we don’t know or can’t imagine what data we need. A textbook example of this comes via Abraham Wald’s analysis of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d\">how to improve the placement of armor on World War II-era bombers</a>: Wald wanted to study the bombers that had been shot down, which was practically impossible. However, he was able to make inferences about the effect of what is now called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\"> survivor bias</a> by factoring in what was missing, i.e., that the planes that returned from successful missions had an inverse pattern of damage relative to those that had been shot down. His insight was a corrective to the collective bias of the Army’s Statistical Research Group (SRG). The SRG could not imagine that it was missing data.</p>\\n<h3>No data quality issue is an island entire of itself</h3>\\n<p>Organizations aren’t dealing with only one data quality issue. It’s more complicated than that—with more than half of respondents reporting at least four data quality issues.</p>\\n<p>Figure 6, below, combines two things. The dark green portion of each horizontal bar shows the share of survey respondents who reported that specific number of discrete data quality issues at their organizations&nbsp; (i.e., 3 issues or 4 issues, etc.). The light gray/green portion of each bar shows the aggregate share of respondents who reported <em>at least</em> that number of data quality issues (i.e., at least 2 issues, at least 3 issues, etc.).</p>\\n<p>A few highlights to help navigate this complex chart:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Respondents most often report either three or four data quality issues. The dark green portion of the horizontal bars show about 16% of respondents for each of these results.</li>\\n<li>Looking at the aggregates of the “at least 4” and “at least 3” items, we see the light gray/green section of the chart shows 56% of respondents reporting at least four data quality issues and 71% reporting at least three data quality issues.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>That organizations face myriad data quality issues is not a surprise. What is surprising is that organizations don’t more often take a structured or formal approach to addressing their own unique, gnarly combination of data quality challenges.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-5.png\" alt=\"Number of data quality issues reported\"><figcaption>Figure 6. Number of data quality issues reported.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Lineage and provenance continue to lag</h3>\\n<p>A significant majority of respondents—almost 80%—say their organizations do not publish information about data provenance or data lineage.</p>\\n<p>If this is surprising, it shouldn’t be. Lineage and provenance are inextricably bound with data governance, which overlaps significantly with data quality. As we saw, most organizations are failing Data Governance 101. Data scientists, data engineers, software developers, and other technologists use provenance data to verify the output of a workflow or data processing pipeline—or, as often as not, to diagnose problems. Provenance notes where the data in a data set came from; which transformations, if any, have been applied to it; and other technical minutiae.</p>\\n<p>With respect to business intelligence and analytics, data lineage provides a mechanism business people, analysts, and auditors can use to trust and verify data. If an auditor has questions about the values in a report or the contents of a data set, they can use the data lineage record to retrace its history. In this way, provenance and lineage give us confidence that the content of a data set is both explicable and reproducible.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-6.png\" alt=\"Data provenance and lineage tools\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 7. Data provenance and lineage tools.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Of the 19% of survey respondents whose organizations <em>do</em> manage lineage and provenance, slightly less than 30% say they use a version control system—<em>a la</em> Git—to do this (Figure 7). Another one-fifth use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface\">notebook</a> environment (such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter\">Jupyter</a>). The remaining 50% (i.e., of respondents whose organizations do publish lineage and provenance) use a smattering of open source and commercial libraries and tools, most of which are mechanisms for managing provenance, not lineage.</p>\\n<p>If provenance and lineage are so important, why do few organizations publish information about them?</p>\\n<p>Because lineage, especially, is hard. It imposes access and use constraints that make it more difficult for business people to do what they want with data—especially as regards sharing and/or changing it. First-generation self-service analytic tools made it easier—and, in some cases, <em>possible</em>—for people to share and experiment with data. But the ease-of-use and agency that these tools promoted came at a price: first-gen self-service tools eschewed data lineage, metadata management, and other, similar mechanisms.</p>\\n<p>A best practice for capturing data lineage is to incorporate mechanisms for generating and managing metadata—including lineage metadata—into front- and back-end tools. ETL tools are a textbook example of this: almost all ETL tools generate <a href=\"https://unifisoftware.com/blog/2019/04/in-the-beginninglineage-part-iii/\">granular (“technical”) lineage data</a>. Until recently, however, most self-service tools lacked rich metadata management features or capabilities.</p>\\n<p>This might explain why nearly two-thirds of respondents whose organizations do <em>not</em> publish provenance and lineage answered “No” to the follow-up question: “Does your organization <em>plan</em> on implementing tools or processes to publish data provenance and lineage?” For the vast majority of organizations, provenance and lineage is a dream deferred (Figure 8).</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-7.png\" alt=\"Plans for publishing data provenance and lineage\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 8. Plans for publishing data provenance and lineage.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The good news is that the pendulum could be swinging in the direction of governance.</p>\\n<p>Slightly more than one-fifth selected “Within the next year” in response to this question, while about one-sixth answered “Beyond next year.” Most popular open source programming and analytic environments (Jupyter Notebooks, the R environment, even Linux itself) support data provenance via built-in or third-party projects and libraries. Commercial data analysis tools now offer increasingly robust metadata management features. In the same way, data catalog vendors, too, are making metadata management—with an emphasis on data lineage—a priority. Meanwhile, the Linux Foundation sponsors <a href=\"https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria\">Egeria</a>, an open source standard for metadata management and exchange.</p>\\n<h3>Data quality is not a team effort</h3>\\n<p>Based on feedback from respondents, comparatively few organizations have created dedicated data quality teams (Figure 9). Most (70%) answered “No” to the question “Does your organization have a dedicated data quality team?”</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-8.png\" alt=\"Presence of dedicated data quality teams in organizations\"><figcaption>Figure 9. Presence of dedicated data quality teams in organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Few respondents who answered “Yes” to this question actually work on their organization’s dedicated data quality team. Nearly two-thirds (62%) answered “No” to the follow-up question “Do you work on the dedicated data quality team?”; just 38% answered “Yes.” Only respondents who answered “Yes” to the question “Does your organization have a dedicated data quality team?” were permitted to answer the follow-up. All told, 12% of all survey respondents work on a dedicated data quality team.</p>\\n<h3>Real-time data on the rise</h3>\\n<p>Relatedly, we asked respondents who work in organizations that do have dedicated data quality teams if these teams also work with real-time data.</p>\\n<p>Almost two-thirds (about 61%) answered “Yes.” We know from other research that organizations are prioritizing efforts to do more with real-time data. In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics-to-watch-at-the-strata-data-conference-in-new-york-2019/\">our recent analysis of Strata Conference speakers’ proposals</a>, for example, terms that correlate with real-time use cases were entrenched in the first tier of proposal topics. “Stream” was the No. 4 overall term; “Apache Kafka,” a stream-processing platform, was No. 17; and “real-time” itself sat at No. 44.</p>\\n<p>“Streaming” isn’t identical with “real-time,” of course. But there <em>is</em> evidence for overlap between <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=kafka+%22real-time+data%22&amp;oq=kafka+%22real-time+data%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3886j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">the use of stream-processing technologies and so-called “real-time” use cases</a>. Similarly, the rise of next-gen architectural regimes (such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices\">microservices architecture</a>) is also driving demand for real-time data: A microservices architecture consists of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of services, each of which generates logging and diagnostic data in real-time. Architects and software engineers are building <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability\">observability</a>—basically, monitoring on steroids—into these next-gen apps to make it easier to diagnose and fix problems. This is a compound real-time data and real-time analytics problem.</p>\\n<h3>The world is not a monolith</h3>\\n<p>For the most part, organizations in North America seem to be dealing with the same problems as their counterparts in other regions. Industry representation, job roles, employment experience, and other indicia were surprisingly consistent across all regions—although there were a few intriguing variances. For example, the proportion of “directors/vice presidents” was about one-third higher for North American respondents than for the rest of the world, while the North American proportion of consulting/professional services respondents was close to half the tally for the rest of the globe.</p>\\n<p>Our analysis surfaced at least one other intriguing geographical variance. As noted in Figure 9, we asked each participant if their organization maintains a dedicated data quality team. While North America and the rest of the world had about the same share of respondents with dedicated data quality teams, our North American respondents were less likely to <em>work</em> on that data quality team.</p>\\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\\n<p>A review of the survey results yields a few takeaways organizations can use to realistically address how they can condition their data to improve the efficacy of their analytics and models.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Most organizations should take formal steps to condition and improve their data, such as creating dedicated data quality teams. But conditioning data is an on-going process, not a one-and-done panacea. This is why C-suite buy-in—as difficult as it is to obtain—is a prerequisite for sustained data quality remediation. Promoting C-suite understanding and commitment may require education as many execs have little or no experience working with data or analytics.</li>\\n<li>Conditioning is neither easy nor cheap. Committing to formal processes and dedicated teams helps set expectations about the difficult work of remediating data issues. High costs should compel organizations to take an ROI-based approach to how and where to deploy their data conditioning resources. This includes deciding what is not worth addressing.</li>\\n<li>Organizations that pursue AI initiatives usually discover that they have data quality issues hiding in plain sight. The problem (and partial solution) is that they need quality data to power their AI projects. Think of AI as the carrot, and of poor data as the proverbial stick. The upshot is that investment in AI can become a catalyst for data quality remediation.</li>\\n<li>AI is an answer, but not the only one. AI-enriched tools can improve productivity and simplify much of the work involved in improving data efficacy. But our survey results suggest that a dedicated data quality team also helps to foster the use of AI-enriched tools. What’s more, a dedicated team is motivated to invest in learning to use these tools well; conversely, few analysts and data engineers have the time or capacity to fully master these tools.</li>\\n<li>Data governance is all well and good, but organizations need to start with more basic stuff: data dictionaries to help explain data; tracking provenance, lineage, recency; and other essentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/i98UOAM44uo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
